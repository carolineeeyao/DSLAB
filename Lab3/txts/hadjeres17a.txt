Abstract

This paper introduces DeepBach    graphical
model aimed at modeling polyphonic music and
speci cally hymnlike pieces  We claim that  after being trained on the chorale harmonizations
by Johann Sebastian Bach  our model is capable
of generating highly convincing chorales in the
style of Bach  DeepBach   strength comes from
the use of pseudoGibbs sampling coupled with
an adapted representation of musical data  This
is in contrast with many automatic music composition approaches which tend to compose music sequentially  Our model is also steerable in
the sense that   user can constrain the generation
by imposing positional constraints such as notes 
rhythms or cadences in the generated score  We
also provide   plugin on top of the MuseScore
music editor making the interaction with DeepBach easy to use 

  Introduction
The composition of polyphonic chorale music in the style
of      Bach has represented   major challenge in automatic
music composition over the last decades  The corpus of
the chorale harmonizations by Johann Sebastian Bach is
remarkable by its homogeneity and its size   chorales
in  Bach    All these short pieces  approximately
one minute long  are written for   fourpart chorus  soprano  alto  tenor and bass  using similar compositional
principles  the composer takes   wellknown  at that time 
melody from   Lutheran hymn and harmonizes it      the
three lower parts  alto  tenor and bass  accompanying the
soprano  the highest part  are composed  see Fig  for an
example

Moreover  since the aim of reharmonizing   melody is to
give more power or new insights to its text  the lyrics have
to be understood clearly  We say that voices are in homophony       they articulate syllables simultaneously  This
implies characteristic rhythms  variety of harmonic ideas as
well as characteristic melodic movements which make the
style of these chorale compositions easily distinguishable 
even for non experts 
The dif culty  from   compositional point of view comes
from the intricate interplay between harmony  notes sounding at the same time  and voice movements  how   single voice evolves through time  Furthermore  each voice
has its own  style  and its own coherence  Finding  
choralelike reharmonization which combines Bachlike
harmonic progressions with musically interesting melodic
movements is   problem which often takes years of practice
for musicians 
From the point of view of automatic music generation  the
 rst solution to this apparently highly combinatorial problem was proposed by  Ebcioglu    in   This problem is seen as   constraint satisfaction problem  where the
system must ful ll numerous handcrafted constraints characterizing the style of Bach  It is   rulebased expert system
which contains no less than   rules and tries to reharmonize   given melody with   generateand test method
and intelligent backtracking  Among the short examples
presented at the end of the paper  some are  awless  The
drawbacks of this method are  as stated by the author  the
considerable effort to generate the rule base and the fact
that the harmonizations produced  do not sound like Bach 
except for occasional Bachian patterns and cadence formulas  In our opinion  the requirement of an expert knowledge implies   lot of subjective choices 
  neuralnetwork based solution was later developed by
 Hild et al    This method relies on several neural
networks  each one trained for solving   speci   task   
harmonic skeleton is  rst computed then re ned and ornamented    similar approach is adopted in  Allan  
Williams    but uses Hidden Markov Models  HMMs 
instead of neural networks  Chords are represented as
lists of intervals and form the states of the Markov mod

    Original text and melody by Georg Neumark  

    Fourvoice harmonization by Bach  voices are determined by the staff
they are written on and the directions of the stems 

Figure   Two versions of  Wer nur den lieben Gott       walten  The original melody     and its reharmonization     by Johann Sebastian
Bach  BWV    

els  These approaches produce interesting results even if
they both use expert knowledge and bias the generation
by imposing their compositional process 
In  Whorley
et al    Whorley   Conklin    authors elaborate
on those methods by introducing multiple viewpoints and
variations on the sampling method  generated sequences
which violate  rules of harmony  are put aside for instance  However  this approach does not produce   convincing choralelike texture  rhythmically as well as harmonically and the resort to handcrafted criteria to assess
the quality of the generated sequences might rule out many
musicallyinteresting solutions 
Recently  agnostic approaches  requiring no knowledge
about harmony  Bach   style or music  using neural networks have been investigated with promising results 
In
 BoulangerLewandowski et al    chords are modeled with Restricted Boltzmann Machines  RBMs  Their
temporal dependencies are learned using Recurrent Neural
Networks  RNNs  Variations of these architectures based
on Long ShortTerm Memory  LSTM  units  Hochreiter  
Schmidhuber    Mikolov et al    or GRUs  Gated
Recurrent Units  have been developed by  Lyu et al   
and  Chung et al    respectively  However  these models which work on piano roll representations of the music
are too general to capture the speci city of Bach chorales 
Also    major drawback is their lack of  exibility  Generation is performed from left to right    user cannot interact
with the system  it is impossible to do reharmonization for
instance which is the essentially how the corpus of Bach
chorales was composed  Moreover  their invention capacity and nonplagiarism abilities are not demonstrated 
  method that addresses the rigidity of sequential generation in music was  rst proposed in  Sakellariou et al   
Sakellariou et al    for monophonic music and later
generalized to polyphony in  Hadjeres et al    These
approaches advocate for the use of Gibbs sampling as  
generation process in automatic music composition 
The most recent advances in chorale harmonization is
arguably the BachBot model  Liang      LSTMbased approach speci cally designed to deal with Bach

chorales  This approach relies on little musical knowledge
 all chorales are transposed in   common key  and is able
to produce highquality chorale harmonizations  However 
compared to our approach  this model is less general  produced chorales are all in the   key for instance  and less
 exible  only the soprano can be  xed  Similarly to our
work  the authors evaluate their model with an online Turing test to assess the ef ciency of their model  They also
take into account the fermata symbols  Fig    which are
indicators of the structure of the chorales 
In this paper we introduce DeepBach    dependency network  Heckerman et al    capable of producing musically convincing fourpart chorales in the style of Bach by
using   Gibbslike sampling procedure  Contrary to models based on RNNs  we do not sample from left to right
which allows us to enforce positional  unary userde ned
constraints such as rhythm  notes  parts  chords and cadences  DeepBach is able to generate coherent musical
phrases and provides  for instance  varied reharmonizations
of melodies without plagiarism 
Its core features are its
speed  the possible interaction with users and the richness
of harmonic ideas it proposes  Its ef ciency opens up new
ways of composing Bachlike chorales for non experts in
an interactive manner similarly to what is proposed in  Papadopoulos et al    for leadsheets 
In Sect    we present the DeepBach model for fourpart
chorale generation  We discuss in Sect    the results of
an experimental study we conducted to assess the quality
of our model  Finally  we provide generated examples in
Sect    and elaborate on the possibilities offered by our
interactive music composition editor in Sect    All examples can be heard on the accompanying web page  and
the code of our implementation is available on GitHub 
Even if our presentation focuses on Bach chorales  this
model has been successfully applied to other styles and
composers including Monteverdi  vevoice madrigals to
Palestrina masses

DeepBach    Steerable Model for Bach Chorales Generation

  DeepBach
In this paper we introduce   generative model which takes
into account the distinction between voices  Sect   
presents the data representation we used  This representation is both  tted for our sampling procedure and more
accurate than many data representation commonly used
in automatic music composition  Sect    presents the
model   architecture and Sect    our generation method 
Finally  Sect    provides implementation details and indicates how we preprocessed the corpus of Bach chorale
harmonizations 

  Data Representation

  NOTES AND VOICES

We use MIDI pitches to encode notes and choose to model
voices separately  We consider that only one note can be
sung at   given time and discard chorales with voice divisions 
Since Bach chorales only contain simple time signatures 
we discretize time with sixteenth notes  which means that
each beat is subdivided into four equal parts  Since there is
no smaller subdivision in Bach chorales  there is no loss of
information in this process 
In this setting    voice Vi       
    is   list of notes indexed
by          where   is the duration piece  in sixteenth
notes 

  RHYTHM

We choose to model rhythm by simply adding   hold symbol     coding whether or not the preceding note is held to
the list of existing notes  This representation is thus unambiguous  compact and wellsuited to our sampling method
 see Sect   

  METADATA

The music sheet  Fig      conveys more information than
only the notes played  We can cite 

  the lyrics 
  the key signature 
  the time signature 
  the beat index 
  an implicit metronome  on which subdivision of the

beat the note is played 

  the fermata symbols  see Fig   
 We adopt the standard notation      to denote the set of inte 

gers              for any integer   

  current key 
  current key signature 
  current mode  major minor dorian 

Figure   Fermata symbol 

In the following  we will only take into account the fermata
symbols  the subdivision indexes and the current key signature  To this end  we introduce 

  The fermata list   that indicates if there is   fermata symbol  see Fig    over the current note  it is
  Boolean value  If   fermata is placed over   note
on the music sheet  we consider that it is active for all
time indexes within the duration of the note 

  The subdivision list   that contains the subdivision indexes of the beat  It is an integer between   and  
there is no distinction between beats in   bar so that
our model is able to deal with chorales with three and
four beats per measure 

  CHORALE

We represent   chorale as   couple
     

 
composed of voices and metadata  For Bach chorales    is
  list of   voices Vi for        soprano  alto  tenor and
bass  and     collection of metadata lists    and   
Our choices are very general and do not involve expert
knowledge about harmony or scales but are only mere observations of the corpus  The list   acts as   metronome 
The list   is added since fermatas in Bach chorales indicate the end of each musical phrase  The use of fermata to
this end is   speci city of Bach chorales that we want to
take advantage of

DeepBach    Steerable Model for Bach Chorales Generation

  Model Architecture
We choose to consider the metadata sequences in   as
given  For clarity  we suppose in this section that our
dataset is composed of only one chorale written as in Eq   
of size     We de ne   dependency network on the  nite set
    by specifying   set of conditional
of variables         
probability distributions  parametrized by parameter      

 cid pi      

                 cid 

         

 

where    
  indicates the note of voice   at time index   and
      all variables in   except from the variable    
    As we
want our model to be time invariant so that we can apply it
to sequences of any size  we share the parameters between
all conditional probability distributions on variables lying
in the same voice      

          

pi   pi            

Finally  we    each of these conditional probability distributions on the data by maximizing the loglikelihood  Due
to weight sharing  this amounts to solving four classi cation problems of the form 

log pi    

              

for      

 

 cid 

 

max

  

where the aim is to predict   note knowing the value of its
neighboring notes  the subdivision of the beat it is on and
the presence of fermatas  The advantage with this formulation is that each classi er has to make predictions within  
small range of notes whose ranges correspond to the notes
within the usual voice ranges  see  
For accurate predictions and in order to take into account
the sequential aspect of the data  each classi er is modeled using four neural networks  two Deep Recurrent Neural Networks  Pascanu et al    one summing up past
information and another summing up information coming
from the future together with   nonrecurrent neural network for notes occurring at the same time  Only the last
output from the uppermost RNN layer is kept  These three
outputs are then merged and passed as the input of   fourth
neural network whose output is pi    
             Figure   shows   graphical representation for one of these
models  Details are provided in Sect    These choices
of architecture somehow match real compositional practice
on Bach chorales 
Indeed  when reharmonizing   given
melody  it is often simpler to start from the cadence and
write music  backwards 

  Generation

  ALGORITHM

Figure   Graphical representations of DeepBach   neural network architecture for the soprano prediction   

Monte Carlo  MCMC  algorithm is described in Alg  It is
similar to the classical Gibbs sampling procedure  Geman
  Geman    on the difference that the conditional distributions are potentially incompatible  Chen   Ip   
This means that the conditional distributions of Eq    do
not necessarily comes from   joint distribution      and
that the theoretical guarantees that the MCMC converges
to this stationary joint distribution vanish  We experimentally veri ed that it was indeed the case by checking that
the Markov Chain of Alg  violates Kolmogorov   criterion
 Kelly    it is thus not reversible and cannot converge
to   joint distribution whose conditional distributions match
the ones used for sampling 
However  this Markov chain converges to another stationary distribution and applications on real data demonstrated
that this method yielded accurate joint probabilities  especially when the inconsistent probability distributions are
learned from data  Heckerman et al    Furthermore 
nonreversible MCMC algorithms can in particular cases be
better at sampling that reversible Markov Chains  Vucelja 
 

  FLEXIBILITY OF THE SAMPLING PROCEDURE

The advantage of this method is that we can enforce userde ned constraints by tweaking Alg   

Generation in dependency networks is performed using the
pseudoGibbs sampling procedure  This Markov Chain

  instead of choosing voice   from   to   we can choose
to    the soprano and only resample voices from

  more generally  we can impose any metadata

ourselves to some speci   chorales by resampling

at step   This allows us for instance to    rhythm

ranges 

  PERFORMANCE

Note that it is possible to make generation faster by making
parallel Gibbs updates on GPU  Steps   to   from Alg   
can be run simultaneously to provide signi cant speedups 
Even if it is known that this approach is biased  De Sa et al 
   since we can update simultaneously variables which
are not conditionally independent  we experimentally observed that for small batch sizes   or   DeepBach still
generates samples of great musicality while running ten
times faster than the sequential version  This allows DeepBach to generate chorales in   few seconds 
It is also possible to use the harddisk con gurations generation algorithm  Alg  in  Krauth    to appropriately
choose all the time indexes at which we parallelly resample
so that 

  every time index is at distance at least   from the other

time indexes

  con gurations of time indexes satisfying the relation

above are equally sampled 

This trick allows to assert that we do not update simultaneously   variable and its local context 

  IMPORTANCE OF THE DATA REPRESENTATION

We emphasize on this section the importance of our particular choice of data representation with respect to our sampling procedure  The fact that we obtain great results using
pseudoGibbs sampling relies exclusively on our choice to
integrate the hold symbol into the list of notes 
Indeed  Gibbs sampling fails to sample the true joint distribution          when variables are highly correlated 
creating isolated regions of high probability states in which
the MCMC chain can be trapped  However  many data representations used in music modeling such as

  the pianoroll representation 
  the couple  pitch  articulation  representation where
articulation is   Boolean value indicating whether or
not the note is played or held 

tend to make the musical data suffer from this drawback 
As an example  in the pianoroll representation    long note
is represented as the repetition of the same value over many
variables  In order to only change its pitch  one needs to
change simultaneously   large number of variables  which
is exponentially rare  while this is achievable with only one
variable change with our representation 

  Implementation Details

We implemented DeepBach using Keras  Chollet   
with the Tensor ow  Abadi et al    backend  We
used the database of chorale harmonizations by     
Bach included in the music  toolkit  Cuthbert   Ariza 
  After removing chorales with instrumental parts
and chorales containing parts with two simultaneous notes
 bass parts sometimes divide for the last chord  we ended
up with   pieces  Contrary to other approaches which
transpose all chorales to the same key  usually in   major
or   minor  we choose to augment our dataset by adding
all chorale transpositions which    within the vocal ranges
de ned by the initial corpus  This gives us   corpus of  
chorales and split it between   training set   and   validation set   The vocal ranges contains less than  
different pitches for each voice         for the soprano  alto  tenor and bass parts respectively 
As shown in Fig    we model only local interactions between   note    
  and its context                 only elements with time index   between        and        are

DeepBach    Steerable Model for Bach Chorales Generation

taken as inputs of our model for some scope     This approximation appears to be accurate since musical analysis
reveals that Bach chorales do not exhibit clear longterm
dependencies 
The reported results in Sect    and examples in Sect   
were obtained with        We chose as the  neural
network brick  in Fig      neural network with one hidden layer of size   and ReLU  Nair   Hinton   
nonlinearity and as the  Deep RNN brick  two stacked
LSTMs  Hochreiter   Schmidhuber    Mikolov et al 
  each one being of size    see Fig        in  Li  
Wu    The  embedding brick  applies the same neural network to each time slice  Vt Mt  There are  
dropout on input and   dropout after each layer 
We experimentally found that sharing weights between the
left and right embedding layers improved neither validation
accuracy nor the musical quality of our generated chorales 

  Experimental Results
We evaluated the quality of our model with an online test
conducted on human listeners 

  Setup

For the parameters used in our experiment  see Sect   We
compared our model with two other models    Maximum
Entropy model  MaxEnt  as in  Hadjeres et al    and
  Multilayer Perceptron  MLP  model 
The Maximum Entropy model is   neural network with no
hidden layer  It is given by

where   is   vector containing the elements in        Mt 
Ai    ni  mi  matrix and bi   vector of size mi with mi
being the size of    ni the number of notes in the voice
range   and Softmax the softmax function given by

notes  notes that sound the same but that are written differently         and Gb  This difference in Bach chorales
is unambiguous and it is thus natural to consider the full
name of the notes  like    Db  or    From   machine
learning point of view  these notes would appear in totally
different contexts  This improvement enables the model to
generate notes with the correct spelling  which is important
when we focus on the music sheet rather than on its audio
rendering 

  STEERING MODULATIONS
We added the current key signature list   to the metadata    This allows users to impose modulations and key
changes  Each element Kt of this list contains the number
of sharps of the estimated key for the current bar  It is   integer between   and   The current key is computed using
the key analyzer algorithm from music 

  Generation examples

We now provide and comment on examples of chorales
generated using the DeepBach plugin  Our aim is to show
the quality of the solutions produced by DeepBach  For
these examples  no note was set by hand and we asked
DeepBach to generate regions longer than one bar and covering all four voices 
Despite some compositional errors like parallel octaves 
the musical analysis reveals that the DeepBach compositions reproduce typical Bachlike patterns  from characteristic cadences to the expressive use of nonchord tones  As
discussed in Sect    DeepBach also learned the correct
spelling of the notes  Among examples in Fig    examples
    and     share the same metadata      and    This
demonstrates that even with  xed metadata it is possible to
generate contrasting chorales 
Since we aimed at producing music that could not be distinguished from actual Bach compositions  we had all provided extracts sung by the Wishful Singing choir  These
audio  les can be heard on the accompanying website 

  Discussion and future work
We described DeepBach    probabilistic model together
with   sampling method which is  exible  ef cient and provides musically convincing results even to the ears of professionals  The strength of our method is the possibility to
let users impose unary constraints  which is   feature often
neglected in probabilistic models of music  Through our
graphical interface  the composition of polyphonic music
becomes accessible to nonspecialists  The playful interaction between the user and this system can boost creativity and help explore new ideas quickly  We believe that
this approach could form   starting point for   novel com

to detect badlysounding chords even for non musicians 
We also plotted speci   results for each of the   extracts 
Fig    shows for each reharmonization extract the percentage of Bach votes it collected  more than half of the DeepBach   automaticallycomposed extracts has   majority of
votes considering them as being composed by      Bach
while it is only   third for the MLP model 

  Interactive composition
  Description

We developed   plugin on top of the MuseScore music
editor allowing   user to call DeepBach on any rectangular region  Even if the interface is minimal  see Fig 
the possibilities are numerous  we can generate   chorale
from scratch  reharmonize   melody and regenerate   given
chord  bar or part  We believe that this interplay between  
user and the system can boost creativity and can interest  
wide range of audience 

  Adapting the model

We made two major changes between the model we described for the online test and the interactive composition
tool 

  NOTE ENCODING

We changed the MIDI encoding of the notes to   full
name encoding of the notes  Indeed  some information is
lost when reducing   music sheet to its MIDI representation since we cannot differentiate between two enharmonic
