Abstract

Given   graphical model  one essential problem is MAP inference  that is   nding the most
likely con guration of states according to the
model  Although this problem is NPhard  large
instances can be solved in practice and it is  
major open question is to explain why this is
true  We give   natural condition under which we
can provably perform MAP inference in polynomial time we require that the number of fractional vertices in the LP relaxation exceeding the
optimal solution is bounded by   polynomial in
the problem size  This resolves an open question
by Dimakis  Gohari  and Wainwright  In contrast  for general LP relaxations of integer programs  known techniques can only handle   constant number of fractional vertices whose value
exceeds the optimal solution  We experimentally
verify this condition and demonstrate how ef 
cient various integer programming methods are
at removing fractional solutions

The MAP problem on binary  pairwise graphical models
contains  as   special case  the Maxcut problem and is
therefore NPhard  For this reason    signi cant amount of
attention has focused on analyzing the LP relaxation of the
ILP  which can be solved ef ciently in practice

This relaxation has been an area of intense research in machine learning and statistics  In  Meshi et al    the authors state that   major open question is to identify why real
world instances of Problem   can be solved ef ciently despite the theoretical worst case complexity 
We make progress on this open problem by analyzing the
fractional vertices of the LP relaxation  that is  the extreme points of the polytope with fractional coordinates 
Vertices of the relaxed polytope with fractional coordinates
are called pseudomarginals for graphical models and pseudocodewords in coding theory  If   fractional vertex has
higher objective value       likelihood  compared to the best
integral one  the LP relaxation fails  We call fractional vertices with an objective value at least as good as the objective

value of the optimal integral vertex confounding vertices 
Our main result is that it is possible to prune all confounding vertices ef ciently when their number is polynomial 
Our contributions 

  Our  rst contribution is   general result on integer programs  We show that any   integer linear program
 ILP  can be solved exactly in polynomial time  if the
number confounding vertices is bounded by   polynomial  This applies to MAP inference for   graphical
model over any alphabet size and any order of connection  The same result  exact solution if the number of confounding vertices is bounded by   polynomial  was established by  Dimakis et al    for the
special case of LP decoding of LDPC codes  Feldman et al    The algorithm from  Dimakis et al 
  relies on the special structure of the graphical
models that correspond to LDPC codes  In this paper
we generalize this result for any ILP in the unit hypercube  Our results extend to  nding all integral vertices
among the Mbest vertices 

  Given our condition  one may be tempted to think that
we generate the top Mbest vertices of   linear program  for   polynomial  and output the best integral
one in this list  We actually show that such an approach would be computationally intractable  Specifically  we show that it is NPhard to produce   list
of the Mbest vertices if          for any  xed
      This result holds even if the list is allowed
to be approximate  This strengthens the previously
known hardness result  Angulo et al    which
was          for the exact Mbest vertices  In
terms of achievability  the best previously known result  from  Angulo et al    can only solve the
ILP if there is at most   constant number of confounding vertices 

  We obtain   complete characterization of the fractional vertices of the local polytope for binary  pairwise graphical models  We show that any variable in
the fractional support must be connected to   frustrated cycle by other fractional variables in the graphical model  This is   complete structural characterization that was not previously known  to the best of our
knowledge 

  We develop an approach to estimate the number of
confounding vertices of   halfintegral polytope  We
use this method in an empirical evaluation of the
number of confounding vertices of previously studied
problems and analyze how well common integer programming techniques perform at pruning confounding
vertices 

  Background and Related Work
For some classes of graphical models  it is possible to solve
the MAP problem exactly  For example see  Weller et al 
  for balanced and almost balanced models   Jebara 
  for perfect graphs  and  Wainwright et al    for
graphs with constant treewidth 
These conditions are often not true in practice and   wide
variety of general purpose algorithms are able to solve the
MAP problem for large inputs  One class is belief propagation and its variants  Yedidia et al    Wainwright et al 
  Sontag et al    Another class involves general
ILP optimization methods  see       Nemhauser   Wolsey 
  Techniques specialized to graphical models include
cuttingplane methods based on the cycle inequalities  Sontag   Jaakkola    Komodakis   Paragios    Sontag et al    See also  Kappes et al    for   comparative survey of techniques 
In  Weller et al    the authors investigate how pseudomarginals and relaxations relate to the success of the Bethe
approximation of the partition function 
There has been substantial prior work on improving inference building on these LP relaxations  especially for
LDPC codes in the information theory community  This
work ranges from very fast solvers that exploit the special structure of the polytope  Burshtein    connections to unequal error protection  Dimakis et al   
and graphical model covers  Koetter et al    LP
decoding currently provides the best known  nitelength
errorcorrection bounds for LDPC codes both for random
 Daskalakis et al    Arora et al    and adversarial bit ipping errors  Feldman et al   
For binary graphical models  there is   body of work which
tries to exploit the persistency of the LP relaxation  that
is  the property that integer components in the solution of
the relaxation must take the same value in the optimal solution  under some regularity assumptions  Boros   Hammer    Rother et al    Fix et al   
Fast algorithms for solving large graphical models in practice include  Ihler et al    Dechter   Rish   
The work most closely related to this paper involves eliminating fractional vertices  socalled pseudocodewords in
coding theory  by changing the polytope or the objective
function  Zhang   Siegel    Chertkov   Stepanov 
  Liu et al

which is relaxed to   linear program by replacing the    
     constraint with           For binary integer programs with the box constraints     xi     for all    every
integral vector   is   vertex of the polytope described by
the constraints of the LP relaxation  However fraction vertices may also be in this polytope  and fractional solutions
can potentially have an objective value larger than every
integral vertex 
If the optimal solution to the linear program happens to
be integral  then this is the optimal solution to the original
integer linear program  If the optimal solution is fractional 
then   variety of techniques are available to tighten the LP
relaxation and eliminate the fractional solution 
We establish   success condition for integer programming
based on the number of confounding vertices  which to the
best of our knowledge was unknown  The algorithm used
in proving Theorem   is   version of branchand bound   
classic technique in integer programming  Land   Doig 
   see  Nemhauser   Wolsey    for   modern reference on integer programming  This algorithm works by
starting with   root node  then branching on   fractional
coordinate by making two new linear programs with all the
constraints of the parent node  with the constraint xi    
added to one new leaf and xi     added to the other  The
decision on which leaf of the tree to branch on next is based
on which leaf has the best objective value  When the best
leaf is integral  we know that this is the best integral solution  This algorithm is formally written in Algorithm  
Theorem   Let    be the optimal integral solution and let
               vM  be the set of confounding vertices in the
LP relaxation  Algorithm   will  nd the optimal integral
solution    after    calls to an LP solver 

Since MAP inference is   binary integer program regardless
of the alphabet size of the variables and order of the clique
potentials  we have the following corollary 
Corollary   Given   graphical model such that the local
polytope has   as cofounding variables  Algorithm   can
 nd the optimal MAP con guration with    calls to an LP
solver 

Cuttingplane methods  which remove   fractional vertex
by introducing   new constraint in the polytope may not
have this property  since this cut may create new confound 

ing vertices  This branchand bound algorithm has the desirable property that it never creates   new fractional vertex 
We note that other branching algorithms  such as the algorithm presented by the authors in  Marinescu   Dechter 
  do not immediately allow us to prove our desired
theorem 
Note that warm starting   linear program with slightly
modi ed constraints allows subsequent calls to an LP
solver to be much more ef cient after the root LP has been
solved 

  Proof of Theorem  

The proof follows from the following invariants 

  At every iteration we remove at least one fractional

vertex 

  Every integral vertex is in exactly one branch 
  Every fractional vertex is in at most one branch 
  No fractional vertices are created by the new con 

straints 

Exact MAP Inference by Avoiding Fractional Vertices

To see the last invariant  note that every vertex of   polytope
can be identi ed by the set of inequality constraints that are
satis ed with equality  see  Bertsimas   Tsitsiklis   
By forcing an inequality constraint to be tight  we cannot
possibly introduce new vertices 

  The MBest LP Problem

As mentioned in the introduction  the algorithm used to
prove Theorem   does not enumerate all the fractional vertices until it  nds an integral vertex  Enumerating the Mbest vertices of   linear program is the Mbest LP problem 
De nition  Given   linear program  min cT           
over   polytope   and   positive integer    the Mbest LP
problem is to optimize

   vM       

cT vk 

This was established by  Angulo et al    to be NPhard
when          We strengthen this result to hardness of
approximation even when        for any      
Theorem   It is NPhard to approximate the Mbest LP
problem by   factor better than      
    for any  xed      

Proof  Consider the circulation polytope described in
 Khachiyan et al    with the graph and weight vector
  described in  Boros et al    By adding an   log    
long series of   bipartite subgraphs  we can make it such
that one long path in the original graph implies   long
paths in the new graph  and thus it is NPhard to  nd any
of these long paths in the new graph  By adding the constraint vector wT       and using the cost function    
the vertices corresponding to the short paths have value
  the vertices corresponding to the long paths have value
     and all other vertices have value   Thus the optimal set has value        
    However it is NPhard to  nd
  set of value greater than      in polynomial time  which
    approximation  Using   padding argument 
gives an     
we can replace   with   

The best known algorithm for the Mbest LP problem is
  generalization of the facet guessing algorithm  Dimakis
et al    developed in  Angulo et al    which
would require   mM   calls to an LP solver  where   is
the number of constraints of the LP  Since we only care
about integral solutions  we can  nd the single best integral
vertex with       calls to an LP solver  and if we want all
of the Kbest integral solutions among the top   vertices
of the polytope  we can  nd these with   nK       calls
to an LPsolver  as we will see in the next section 

  KBest Integral Solutions

Finding the Kbest solutions to general optimization problems has been uses in several machine learning applications  Producing multiple highvalue outputs can be
naturally combined with postprocessing algorithms that
select the most desired solution using additional sideinformation  There is   signi cant volume of work in the
general area  see  Fromer   Globerson    Batra et al 
  for MAP solutions in graphical models and  Eppstein    for   survey on Mbest problems 
We further generalize our theorem to  nd the Kbest integral solutions 
Theorem   Under the assumption that there are less than
  fractional vertices with objective value at least as good
as the Kbest integral solutions  we can  nd all of the Kbest integral solutions    nK       calls to an LP solver 

The algorithm used in this theorem is Algorithm   It combines Algorithm   with the space partitioning technique
used in  Murty    Lawler    If the current optimal
solution in the solution tree is fractional  then we use the
branching technique in Algorithm   If the current optimal
solution in the solution tree    is integral  then we branch
by creating   new leaf for every   not currently constrained
by the parent with the constraint xi      
   

  Fractional Vertices of the Local Polytope
We now describe the fractional vertices of the local polytope for binary  pairwise graphical models  which is described in Equation   It was shown in  Padberg    that
all the vertices of this polytope are halfintegral  that is  all
       see  Weller et al 
coordinates have   value from    
  for   new proof of this 
Given   halfintegral point        
          in the local
polytope  we say that   cycle      VC  EC      is frustrated if there is an odd number of edges ij   EC such that
qij     If   point   has   frustrated cycle  then it is   pseudomarginal  as no probability distribution exists that has
as its singleton and pairwise marginals the coordinates of
   Halfintegral points   with   frustrated cycle do not satisfy the cycle inequalities  Sontag   Jaakkola    Wainwright et al    for all cycles      VC  EC     
 VF   EF       EF  odd we must have

Frustrated cycles allow   solution to be zero on negative
weights in   way that is not possible for any integral solution 
We have the following theorem describing all the vertices
of the local polytope for binary  pairwise graphical models

Theorem   Given   point   in the local polytope    is  
vertex of this polytope if and only if        
          and
the induced subgraph on the fractional nodes of   is such
that every connected component of this subgraph contains
  frustrated cycle 

  Proof of Theorem  

Every vertex   of an ndimensional polytope is such that
there are   constraints such that   satis es them with equality  known as active constraints  see  Bertsimas   Tsitsiklis    Every integral   is thus   vertex of the local
polytope  We now describe the fractional vertices of the local polytope 
         be   point of the local
De nition  Let        
polytope  Let GF    VF   EF   be an induced subgraph of
  for all     VF   We say that GF is
points such that qi    

full rank if the following system of equations is full rank

qij    

 ij   EF such that qij

qi   qij      ij   EF such that qij  
qj   qij      ij   EF such that qij  

 

Theorem   follows from the following lemmas 
Lemma   Let        
         be   point of the local
polytope  Let GF    VF   EF   be the subgraph induced by
the nodes       such that qi    
    The point   is   vertex if
and only if every connected component of GF is full rank 
Lemma   Let        
         be   point of the local
polytope  Let GF    VF   EF   be   connected subgraph
  for all    
induced from nodes such that such that qi    
VF   GF is full rank if and only if GF contains cycle that is
full rank 
Lemma   Let        
         be   point of the local
polytope  Let      VC  EC  be   cycle of   such that qi is
fractional for all     VC    is full rank if and only if   is  
frustrated cycle 

Proof of Lemma   Suppose every connected component is
full rank  Then every fractional node and edge between
fractional nodes is fully speci ed by their corresponding
equations in Problem   It is easy to check that all integral
nodes  edges between integral nodes  and edges between
integral and fractional nodes is also  xed  Thus   is   vertex 
Now suppose that there exists   connected component that
is not full rank  The only other constraints involving this
connected component are those between fractional nodes
and integral nodes  However  note that these constraints are
always rank   and also introduce   new edge variable  Thus
all the constraints where   is tight do not make   full rank
system of equations 

Proof of Lemma   Suppose GF has   full rank cycle  We
will build the graph starting with the full rank cycle then
adding one connected edge at   time  It is easy to see from
Equations   that all new variables introduced to the system
of equations have    xed value  and thus the whole connected component is full rank 
Now suppose GF has no full rank cycle  We will again
build the graph starting from the cycle then adding one connected edge at   time  If we add an edge that connects to  
new node  then we added two variables and two equations 
thus we did not make the graph full rank  If we add an edge
between two existing nodes  then we have   cycle involving
this edge  We introduce two new equations  however with

Exact MAP Inference by Avoiding Fractional Vertices

one of the equations and the other cycle equations  we can
produce the other equation  thus we can increase the rank
by one but we also introduced   new edge  Thus the whole
graph cannot be full rank 

The proof of Lemma   from the following lemma 
Lemma   Consider   collection of   vectors

                     
                       
                         
 

vn                  tn 

vn    tn               

for ti       We have rank               vn      if and
only if there is an odd number of vectors such that ti    

 cid 

Proof of Lemma   Let   be the number of vectors such
that ti     Let         and de ne

Si   

Si   vi 
Si   vi 

if Si          
if Si          

for                    
Note that if ti      then Si         Si       and if
ti      then Si          Si       Thus the number
of times the sign changes is exactly the number of ti    
for                    
Using the value of Sn  we can now we can check for all
values of    and tn that the following is true 

  If   is odd then                 span               vn 
which allows us to create the entire standard basis 
showing the vectors are full rank 

  If   is even then vn   span               vn  and

thus the vectors are not full rank 

  Estimating the number of Confounding

Singleton Marginals

For this section we generalize generalize Theorem   We
see after every iteration we potentially remove more than
one confounding vertex we remove all confounding vertices that agree with xI      and xI      and are fractional
with any value at coordinate    We also observe that we can

handle   mixed integer program  MIP  with the same algorithm

We will call   vertex        fractional if its   component
is fractional  For each fractional vertex        we create  
halfintegral vector      such that

 

 
 
 

       

if xi    
if xi is fractional
if xi    

For   set of vertices     we de ne       to be the set        
                  we remove all duplicate entries 
Theorem   Let        be the optimal integral solution and let VC be the set of confounding vertices  Algorithm   will  nd the optimal integral solution        after
   VC  calls to an LP solver 

For MAP inference in graphical models    VC  refers to
the fractional singleton marginals qV such that there exists
  set of pairwise pseudomarginals qE such that  qV   qE  is
  cofounding vertex  In this case we call qV   confounding
singleton marginal  We develop Algorithm   to estimate the
number of confounding singleton marginals for our experiments section  It is based on the kbest enumeration method
developed in  Murty    Lawler   
Algorithm   works by   branching argument  The root node
is the original LP    leaf node is branched on by introducing   new leaf for every node in   and every element of
   
      such that qi  cid    in the parent node and the constraint  qi      is not in the constraints for the parent node 
For                
      we create the leaf such that it has
all the constraints of its parents plus the constraint qi     
Note that Algorithm   actually generates   superset of the
elements of   VC  since the introduction of constraints of
  introduce vertices into the new polytope
the type qi    
that were not in the original polytope  This does not seem
to be an issue for the experiments we consider  however this
does occur for other graphs  An interesting question is if the
vertices of the local polytope can be provably enumerated 

  Experiments
We consider   synthetic experiment on randomly created
graphical models  which were also used in  Sontag  
Jaakkola    Weller    Weller et al    The
graph topology used is the complete graph on   nodes  We
 rst reparametrize the model to use the suf cient statistics

Wij   Uniform       for varying    The quantity  
determines how strong the connections are between nodes 
We do   draws for each choice of edge strength   
For the complete graph  we observe that Algorithm   does
not yield any points that do not correspond to vertices  however this does occur for other topologies 
We  rst compare how the number of fractional singleton

   VC  is some given value  We observe that    VC  increases as the connection strength increases  Further we see
that while most instances have   small number for    VC 
there are rare instances where    VC  is quite large

Figure   We compare how the number of fractional singleton
marginals    VC   changes with the connection strength    We
plot the sample CDF of the probability that    VC   is some
given value  We observe that    VC   increases as the connection strength increases  Further we see that while most instances
have   small number for    VC   there are rare instances where
   VC   is quite large 

marginals 
We also observe the number of introduced confounding
singleton marginals that are introduced by the cycle constraints increases with the number of confounding singleton marginals in Figure  
Finally we compare the number of branches needed to  nd
the optimal solution increases with the number of confounding singleton marginals in Figure     similar trend
arises as with the number of cycle inequalities introduced 
To compare the methods  note that branchand bound uses
twice as many LP calls as there are branches  For this family of graphical models  branchand bound tends to require
less calls to an LP solver than the cut constraints 

  Conclusion
Perhaps the most interesting followup question to our
work is to determine when  in theory and practice  our condition on the number of confounding pseudomarginals in
the LP relaxation is small  Another interesting question is
to see if it is possible to prune the number of confounding
pseudomarginals at   faster rate  The algorithm presented
for our main theorem removes one pseudomarginal after
two calls to an LP solver  Is it possible to do this at   faster
rate  From our experiments  this seems to be the case in
practice
