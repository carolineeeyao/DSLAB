Abstract

The problem of  nding overlapping communities in networks has gained much attention recently  Optimizationbased approaches use nonnegative matrix factorization  NMF  or variants 
but the global optimum cannot be provably attained in general  Modelbased approaches 
such as the popular mixed membership stochastic
blockmodel or MMSB  Airoldi et al    use
parameters for each node to specify the overlapping communities  but standard inference techniques cannot guarantee consistency  We link
the two approaches  by     establishing suf cient
conditions for the symmetric NMF optimization
to have   unique solution under MMSB  and    
proposing   computationally ef cient algorithm
called GeoNMF that is provably optimal and
hence consistent for   broad parameter regime 
We demonstrate its accuracy on both simulated
and realworld datasets 

  Introduction
Community detection is   fundamental problem in network analysis 
It has been widely used in   diverse
set of applications ranging from link prediction in social networks  Soundarajan   Hopcroft    predicting
proteinprotein or proteinDNA interactions in biological
networks  Chen   Yuan    to network protocol design such as data forwarding in delay tolerant networks  Lu
et al   
Traditional community detection assumes that every node
in the network belongs to exactly one community  but
many practical settings call for greater  exibility  For

instance  individuals in   social network may have multiple interests  and hence are best described as members of multiple interestbased communities  We focus
on the popular mixed membership stochastic blockmodel
 MMSB   Airoldi et al    where each node           
has   discrete probability distribution                   iK 
over   communities  The probability of linkage between
nodes   and   depends on the degree of overlap between
their communities

  Prior work

We categorize existing approaches broadly into three
groups  modelbased parameter inference methods  specialized algorithms that offer provable guarantees  and
optimizationbased methods using nonnegative matrix
factorization 
Modelbased methods  These apply standard techniques
for inference of hidden variables to the MMSB model  Examples include MCMC techniques  Chang    and variational methods  Gopalan   Blei    While these often
work well in practice  there are no proofs of consistency for
these methods  The MCMC methods are dif cult to scale
to large graphs  so we compare against the faster variational
inference methods in our experiments 
Algorithms with provable guarantees  There has been
work on provably consistent estimation on models similar
to MMSB  Zhang et al    propose   spectral method

 OCCAM  for   model where the    has unit  cid  norm  unlike MMSB  where they have unit  cid  norm  In addition to
the standard assumptions regarding the existence of  pure 
nodes   which only belong to   single community  and  
positivede nite    they also require   to have equal diagonal entries  and assume that the ground truth communities has   unique optimum of   special loss function 
and there is curvature around the optimum  Such assumptions may be hard to verify  Ray et al    and Kaufmann et al    consider models with binary community memberships  Kaufmann et al    show that the
global optimum of   special loss function is consistent 
However  achieving the global optimum is computationally
intractable  and the scalable algorithm proposed by them
 SAAC  is not provably consistent  Anandkumar et al 
  propose   tensor based approach for MMSB  Despite their elegant solution the computational complexity is
       which can be prohibitive for large graphs 
Optimizationbased methods  If   is positivede nite 
the MMSB probability matrix   can be written as
    WWT   where the   matrix has only nonnegative
entries  In other words    is the solution to   Symmetric Nonnegative Matrix Factorization  SNMF  problem 
    arg minX  loss    XXT   for some loss function
that measure the  difference  between   and its factorization  SNMF has been widely studied and successfully used
for community detection  Kuang et al    Wang et al 
    Psorakis et al    but typically lacks the
guarantees we desire  Our paper attempts to address these
issues 
We note that Arora et al      used NMF to consistently estimate parameters of   topic model  However 
their results cannot be easily applied to the MMSB inference problem  In particular  for topic models  the columns
of the wordby topic matrix specifying the probability distribution of words in   topic sum to   For MMSB  the rows
of the node membership matrix sum to   The relationship
of this work to the MMSB problem is unclear 

  Problem Statement and Contributions

We seek to answer two problems 
Problem   Given    when does the solution to the SNMF
optimization yield the correct   
The dif culty stems from the fact that     the MMSB model
may not always be identi able  and     even if it is  the corresponding SNMF problem may not have   unique solution

 This is   common assumption even for NMF methods for
topic modeling  where each topic is assumed to have an anchor
word  words belonging to only one topic  Huang et al   
introduced   special optimization criterion to relax the presence
of anchor words  but the optimization criterion is nonconvex 

 even after allowing for permutation of communities 
Even when the conditions for Problem   are met  we may
be unable to  nd   good solution in practice  This is due
to two reasons  First  we only know the adjacency matrix
   and not the probability matrix    Second  the general
SNMF problem is nonconvex  and SNMF algorithms can
get stuck at local optima  Hence  it is unclear if an algorithm can consistently recover the MMSB parameters  This
leads to our next question 
Problem   Given   generated from   MMSB model  can
we develop   fast and provably consistent algorithm to infer
the parameters 
Our goal is to develop   fast algorithm that provably solves
SNMF for an identi able MMSB model  Note that generic
SNMF algorithms typically do not have any provable guarantees 
Our contributions are as follows 

Identi ability  We show conditions that are suf cient for
MMSB to be identi able  speci cally  there must be at least
one  pure  exemplar of each of the   clusters         node
that belongs to that community with probability   and  
must be full rank 

Uniqueness under SNMF  We provide suf cient conditions under which an identi able MMSB model is the
unique solution for the SNMF problem  speci cally  the
MMSB probability matrix   has   unique SNMF solution
if   is diagonal  It is important to note that MMSB with
  diagonal   still allows for interactions between different
communities via members who belong to both 

Recovery algorithm  We present   new algorithm  called
GeoNMF  for recovering the parameters     and   given
only the observed adjacency matrix    The only computeintensive part of the algorithm is the calculation of the topK eigenvalues and eigenvectors of    for which highly optimized algorithms exist  Press et al   

Provable guarantees  Under the common assumption that
   are generated from   Dirichlet  prior  we prove the
consistency of GeoNMF when   is diagonal and there
are  pure  nodes for each cluster  exactly the conditions
needed for uniqueness of SNMF  We allow the sparsity
parameter   to decay with the graph size    All proofs are
deferred to the appendix 

Empirical validation  On simulated networks  we compare GeoNMF against variational methods  SVI   Gopalan
  Blei    Since OCCAM  SAAC  and BSNMF   
Bayesian variant of SNMF  Psorakis et al    are
formed under different model assumptions  we exclude
these for the simulation experiments for fairness  We
also run experiments on Facebook and Google Plus ego

networks collected by Mcauley   Leskovec   coauthorship datasets constructed by us from DBLP  Ley 
  and the Microsoft academic graph  MAG   Sinha
et al    These networks can have up to  
nodes  On these graphs we compare GeoNMF against SVI 
SAAC  OCCAM and BSNMF  We see that GeoNMF is
consistently among the top  while also being one of the
fastest  This establishes that GeoNMF achieves excellent
accuracy and is computationally ef cient in addition to being provably consistent 

  Identi ability and Uniqueness
In order to present our results  we will now introduce some
key de nitions  Similar de nitions appear in  Zhang et al 
 
De nition     node         is called    pure  node if
          such that  ij     and    cid      for all  cid       
 cid   cid    
Identi ability of MMSB  MMSB is not identi able in
general  Consider the following counter example 

   

 
 

 
 

    

      

   

 
 
 

   
 
 
 
   
 

 

 

     

It can be easily checked that
the probability matrices
  generated by the parameter set         
         is exactly the same as that generated by
                   where    is the
identity matrix  This example can be extended to arbitrarily large    for every new row  
added to   add the
row  
     to   The new rows are still nonnegative and sum to   it can be veri ed that        
even after these new node additions 
Thus  while MMSB is not identi able in general  we can
prove identi ability under certain conditions 
Theorem    Suf cient conditions for MMSB identi ability  Suppose parameters     of the MMSB model satisfy
the following conditions      there is at least one pure node
for each community  and       has full rank  Then  MMSB
is identi able up to   permutation 

Since identi ability is   necessary condition for consistent
recovery of parameters  we will assume these conditions
from now on 
Uniqueness of SNMF for MMSB model  Even when the
MMSB model is identi able  the SNMF optimization may
not have   unique solution  In other words  given an MMSB
probability matrix    there might be multiple matrices  
such that     XXT   even if   corresponds to   unique
parameter setting        under MMSB  For SNMF to

work          must the the unique SNMF solution  When does this happen 
In general  SNMF is not unique because   can be permuted  so we consider the following de nition of uniqueness 
De nition  
 Uniqueness of SNMF  Huang et al 
  The Symmetric NMF of     WWT is said to
be  essentially  unique if         WT implies      WZ 
where   is   permutation matrix 
Theorem    Uniqueness of SNMF for MMSB  Consider an identi able MMSB model where   is diagonal  Then  its Symmetric NMF   is unique and equals
     
The above results establish that if we  nd     that is the
symmetric NMF solution of   then it is at least unique 
However 
two practical questions are still unanswered 
First  given the nonconvex nature of SNMF  how can we
guarantee that we  nd the correct   given    Second  in
practice we are given not   but the noisy adjacency matrix
   Typical algorithms for SNMF do not provide guarantees even for the  rst question 

  Provably consistent inference for MMSB
To achieve consistent inference  we turn to the speci  
structure of the MMSB model  We motivate our approach
in three stages  First  note that under the conditions of Theorem   the rows of   form   simplex whose corners
are formed by the pure nodes for each cluster  In addition 
these corners are aligned along different axes  and hence
are orthogonal to each other  Thus  if we can detect the
corners of the simplex  we can recover the MMSB parameters  So the goal is to  nd the pure nodes from different
clusters  since they de ne the corners 
While our goal is to get    note that it is easy to compute VE  where      are the eigenvectors and eigenvalues of   
         VEVT   Thus  WWT  
 VE VE     This implies that     VE  
for some orthogonal matrix    Lemma    of  Tang et al 
  Essentially we should be able to identify the pure
nodes by  nding the corners of the simplex based on   and
  
Once we have found the pure nodes  it is easy to  nd the
rotation matrix   modulo   permutaion of classes  because
we know that the pure nodes are on the axis for the simplex
of    
Now  we note something rather striking  Let   denote
the diagonal matrix with expected degrees on the diagonal  Consider the population Laplacian   PD 
Its square root is given by   VE  which has the
following interesting property for equal Dirichlet parame 

On Mixed Memberships and Symmetric Nonnegative Matrix Factorizations

ters          We show in Lemma   that while the
resulting rows no longer fall on   simplex  the rows with
the largest norm are precisely the pure nodes  for whom the

norm concentrates around cid      Thus  picking the rows

with the largest norm of the square root gives us the pure
nodes  From this        for other rows and the parameters
  and   can again be easily extracted 
Needless to say  this only answers the question for the expectation matrix    In reality  we have   noisy adjacency
matrix  Let    and    denote the matrices of eigenvectors
and eigenvalues of    We also establish in this paper that
the rows of        concentrate around its population counterpart  corresponding row of VE   for some rotation
matrix    While there are eigenvector deviation results
in random matrix theory      
the DavisKahan Theorem
 Davis   Kahan    these typically provide deviation
results for the whole    matrix  not its rows  In   nutshell 
this crucial result lets us carefully bound the errors of each
step of the same basic idea executed on    the noisy proxy

Algorithm   shows our NMF algorithm based on these geometric intuitions for inference under MMSB  henceforth 
GeoNMF  The complexity of GeoNMF is dominated by
the onetime eigendecomposition in step   Thus this algorithm is fast and scalable  The consistency of parameters

Remark   Note that Algorithm   produces two sets of
parameters for the two partitions of the graph   and     In
practice one may need to have parameter estimates of the
entire graph  While there are many ways of doing this 
the most intuitive way would be to look at the set of pure
nodes in    call this Sp  and those in     call this  Sp  If
one looks at the subgraph induced by the union of all these
pure nodes  then with high probability  there should be  
connected components  which will allow us to match the
communities 
Also note that Algorithm   may return    cid    clusters 
However  we show in Lemma   that the pure nodes extracted by our algorithm will be highly separated and with
high probability we will have       for an appropriately
chosen  
Finally  we note that  in our implementation  we construct
the candidate pure node set    step   of Algorithm   by
 nding all nodes with norm within   multiplicative error
of the largest norm  We increase   from   small value 
until  Xp has condition number close to one  This is helpful
when   is small  where asymptotic results do not hold 

  Analysis
We want to prove that the samplebased estimates     
and   concentrate around the corresponding population parameters      and   after appropriate normalization  We
will show this in several steps  which follow the steps of
GeoNMF

Concentration of rows of     We must show that the rows
of the sample    matrix concentrate around   suitably rotated population version  While it is known that    concentrates around suitably rotated    see the variant of DavisKahan Theorem presented in  Yu et al    these results are for columns of the   matrix  not for each row  The
trivial bound for rowwise error would be to upper bound it
by the total error  which is too crude for our purposes  To
get rowwise convergence  we use samplesplitting  similar
ideas can be found in  McSherry    Chaudhuri et al 
  as detailed in steps   to   of GeoNMF  The key
idea is to split the graph in two parts and project the adjacency matrix of one part onto eigenvectors of another part 
Due to independence of these two parts  one can show concentration

Clustering of pure nodes  Once the  nearly  pure nodes
have been selected  we run PartitionPureNodes  Algorithm   on them  We show that these nodes can form exactly   well separated clusters and each cluster only contains nodes whose   are peaked on the same element  and
PartitionPureNodes can select exactly one node from each

of these can be relaxed in practice  For instance  while
we require the Dirichlet parameters to be equal  leading
to balanced cluster sizes  real data experiments show that
our algorithm works well for unbalanced settings as well 
Similarly  the algorithm assumes   diagonal    which is
suf cient for uniqueness  but empirically works well even
in the presence of offdiagonal noise  Finally  splitting the
nodes into   and    is not needed in practice 
  Experiments
We present results on simulated and realworld datasets 
Via simulations  we evaluate the sensitivity of GeoNMF to
the various MMSB parameters  the skewness of the diagonal elements of   and offdiagonal noise  the Dirichlet
parameter   that controls the degree of overlap  the sparsity parameter   and the number of communities    Then 
we evaluate GeoNMF on Facebook and Google Plus ego
networks  and coauthorship networks with upto  
nodes constructed from DBLP and the Microsoft Academic
Network 

Baseline methods  For the realworld networks  we compare GeoNMF against the following methods

nity detection  BSNMF   Psorakis et al   

  the OCCAM algorithm  Zhang et al    for recov 

ering mixed memberships  and

  the SAAC algorithm  Kaufmann et al   

For
the simulation experiments  we only compare
GeoNMF against SVI  since these are the only two methods based speci cally on the MMSB model  BSNMF has  
completely different underlying model  OCCAM requires
rows of   to have unit  cid  norm and   to have equal diagonal elements  and SAAC requires   to be   binary matrix 
while MMSB requires rows of   to have unit  cid  norm 
Since the community identities can only be recovered upto
  permutation  in both simulated and real data experiments 
we  gure out the order of the communities using the well
known Munkres algorithm in  Munkres   

  Simulated data

Our simulations with the MMSB model are shown in Figure   We use         for         While this leads to

implementation of their algorithm because   required library
CULA is no longer open source  and   complementary CPU implementation did not yield good results with default settings 

balanced clusters  note that the real datasets have clusters
of different sizes and we will show that GeoNMF works
consistently well even for those networks  see Section  
Unless otherwise stated  we set             and
     
Evaluation Metric  Since we have ground truth   we
report the relative error of the inferred MMSB parameters
  Here the minimum is taken
  de ned as min
 
over all       permutation matrices  For each experiment  we report the average and the standard deviation over
  random samples  Since all the baseline algorithms only
return   we only report relative error of that

Sensitivity to skewness of the diagonal of    Let

              and plot the relative error against varying     Figure     shows that GeoNMF has much smaller
error than SVI  and is robust to   over   wide range 

Sensitivity to offdiagonal element    While SNMF is
identi able only for diagonal    we still test GeoNMF in
the setting where all offdiagonal entries of   have noise
  Figure     shows once again that GeoNMF is robust to
such noise  and is much more accurate than SVI 

Sensitivity to   In Figure     the relative error is plotted against increasing   larger values corresponding to
larger overlap between communities  Accuracy degrades
with increasing overlap  as expected  but GeoNMF is much
less affected than SVI 

Sensitivity to   Figure     shows relative error against
increasing   For dense networks  both GeoNMF and SVI
perform similarly  but the error of SVI increases drastically
in the sparse regime  small  

Scalability  Figure     shows the wallclock time for networks of different sizes  Both GeoNMF and SVI scale linearly with the number of nodes  but SVI is about   times
slower than GeoNMF

Plus  Gplus  ego networks  where each node can be
part of multiple  circles  or  communities 
  Coauthorship networks  We construct coauthorship
networks from DBLP  each community is   group

Graph  each community is denoted by    eld of
study   FOS  tag  Each author     vector is constructed by normalizing the number of papers he she
has published in conferences in   sub eld  or papers
that have the FOS tag 

We preprocessed the networks by recursively removing
isolated nodes  communities without any pure nodes  and
nodes with no community assignments  For the ego networks we pick networks with at least   nodes and the
average number of nodes per community       is at least
  giving us   Facebook and and   Gplus networks  For
the coauthorship networks  all communities have enough
pure nodes  and after removing isolated nodes  the networks have more than   nodes and     is larger than
  The statistics of the networks  number of nodes  average degree  number of clusters  degree of overlap etc 
are shown in Table   The overlap ratio is the number of
overlapping nodes divided by the number of nodes  The

It is easy to see that RCavg      takes value from   to
  and higher is better  Since SAAC returns binary assignment  we compute its RCavg against the binary ground truth 
Performance  We report the RCavg score in Figure    
averaged over different Faceboook and Gplus networks 
in Figure     for  ve DBLP networks  and in Figure    
for two MAG networks  We show the time in seconds  logscale  in Figure     averaged over Facebook and Gplus
networks  in Figure     for DBLP networks and in Figure     for MAG networks  We averaged over the Facebook and Gplus networks because all the performances
were similar 

  For small networks like Facebook and Gplus  all algorithms perform equally well both in speed and accuracy  although GeoNMF is fast even for relatively
larger Gplus networks 

  DBLP is sparser  and as   result the overall rank correlation decreases  However  GeoNMF consistently
performs well   While for some networks  BSNMF
and OCCAM have comparable RCavg  they are much
slower than GeoNMF 

  MAG is larger  hundreds of thousands of nodes  than
DBLP  For these networks we could not even run
BSNMF because of memory issues  Again  GeoNMF
performs consistently well while outperforming others in speed 

Estimating    While we assume that   is known apriori 
  can be estimated using the USVT estimator  Chatterjee
et al    For the simulated graphs  when average degree is above ten  USVT estimates   correctly  However
for the real graphs  which are often sparse  it typically overestimates the true number of clusters 

  Conclusions
This paper explored the applicability of symmetric NMF
algorithms for inference of MMSB parameters  We showed
broad conditions that ensure identi ability of MMSB  and
then proved suf ciency conditions for the MMSB parameters to be uniquely determined by   general symmetric
NMF algorithm  Since generalpurpose symmetric NMF
algorithms do not have optimality guarantees  we propose
  new algorithm  called GeoNMF  that adapts symmetric
NMF speci cally to MMSB  GeoNMF is not only provably
consistent  but also shows good accuracy in simulated and
realworld experiments  while also being among the fastest
approaches
