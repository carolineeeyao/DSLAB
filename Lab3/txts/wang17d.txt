Abstract

We study the problem of estimating the highdimensional Gaussian graphical model where the
data are arbitrarily corrupted  We propose   robust estimator for the sparse precision matrix in
the highdimensional regime  At the core of our
method is   robust covariance matrix estimator 
which is based on truncated inner product  We
establish the statistical guarantee of our estimator on both estimation error and model selection
consistency  In particular  we show that provided
that the number of corrupted samples    for each
variable satis es      pn plog    where   is
the sample size and   is the number of variables 
the proposed robust precision matrix estimator
attains the same statistical rate as the standard estimator for Gaussian graphical models  In addition  we propose   hypothesis testing procedure
to assess the uncertainty of our robust estimator 
We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method
through extensive experiments on both synthetic

In the highdimensional settings  where the number of
variables   can exceed the number of observations     
large body of literature has studied the problem of precision matrix estimation in Gaussian graphical models and
their variants  Meinshausen     uhlmann    Yuan  
Lin    Friedman et al    Banerjee et al   
Yuan    Cai et al    Wang et al    Xu  
Gu    Xu et al      For instance  Meinshausen     uhlmann   developed   neighborhood
pursuit approach for estimating conditional independence
relationship separately for each node in the graph  This
method estimates the precision matrix by solving   collection of sparse regression problems using Lasso in parallel  Yuan   Lin   Friedman et al    Banerjee
et al    proposed     norm regularized Gaussian negative loglikelihood method  which called Graphical Lasso
 GLasso  to directly estimate the precision matrix  More
recently  Yuan   Cai et al    proposed the graphical Dantzig selector and CLIME  respectively  Both of
these methods can be solved by linear programming and
have more favorable theoretical properties than GLasso 
Note that most of the aforementioned methods rely on the
assumption that the observations follow   Gaussian distribution  There also exists some work  such as Ravikumar
et al    studied subGaussian data under bounded
higher order moments  However  in many realword applications  the data can follow   heavytailed distribution 
or may even be corrupted arbitrarily  In such cases  conventional methods yield inaccurate graph estimation even
if there are only   few contaminated observations due to
the lack of robustness  In order to address this issue    large

focused on providing more robust estimators for precision
matrices in the past years  However  most of these estimators were established under some speci   contamination
models  thus they are not good at dealing with the situation
when data are arbitrarily corrupted 

Robust Gaussian Graphical Model Estimation with Arbitrary Corruption

In this paper  we propose   robust estimator to estimate
the precision matrix in highdimensional GGMs with arbitrarily corrupted data  More speci cally  we consider the
situation that the corrupted data can appear in any coordinates of the observations  This includes situations that
some observations are outliers or data follow some speci  
contamination models as special cases  The de nition of
the arbitrary corruption model will be presented in section
  The key idea of our method is to use   robust covariance
matrix estimator  which remains accurate provided   controlled number of arbitrarily corrupted coordinates  Our
theory provides not only the spectral norm based estimation error of the proposed estimator  but also the model selection consistency guarantee  More importantly  we show
that provided that the number of corrupted samples    for
each variable satis es      pn plog    where   is the
sample size and   is the number of variables  the proposed
robust precision matrix estimator attains the same statistical rate as the standard estimator for Gaussian graphical
models  Beyond point estimation  we also propose   hypothesis testing procedure to assess the uncertainty of our
robust estimator with corrupted observations  and construct
the con dence interval for the point estimate  Thorough experiments on both synthetic data and realworld genomic
data corroborate the effectiveness of our method 
The remainder of this paper is organized as follows  In
Section   we discuss some more related work about the robust precision matrix estimation  Section   summarizes our
proposed estimation method and testing procedure in general and also introduces some necessary backgrounds  Section   presents our main results including estimation error
bound and inference property  Section   provides numerical results  for our method and   number of other methods

  Related Work
In recent years  some attempts have been made toward the
robust estimation of highdimensional GGMs under different corruption models  For example  to deal with heavy
tailed distributions  Liu et al    developed   semiparametric approach called the nonparanormal SKEPTIC 
Finegold   Drton   proposed   penalized likelihood
approach based on multivariate tdistributions  They also
proposed an alternative tmodel which requires the use of
variational EM or Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithms 
Hirose   Fujisawa   introduced   robust estimation
procedure for sparse precision matrices based on the penalized negative  likelihood function 
In order to address outliers  Sun   Li   proposed
  robust estimation of GGMs via   robusti ed likelihood
function with   penalization  In particular  they  rst use
coordinate descent to ef ciently estimate the structure of
the precision matrix  Then  based on the estimated structure  they reestimate the parameters of the precision matrix using iterative proportional  tting algorithm to ensure the positive de niteness of their estimator  Yet their
method does not have any theoretical guarantee  Yang
  Lozano   proposed   trimmed Graphical Lasso
method  Speci cally  by adding weights to different data
points  they improved upon the original graphical Lasso
such that it is more robust to outliers  However  they did not
provide any model selection consistency guarantee  Balmand   Dalalyan   also studied the problem of robustly estimating the covariance matrix when data are corrupted by outliers 
In particular  they proposed to use  
modi ed scaled lasso procedure for covariance matrix estimation and provided the theoretical guarantee of their
method 
Another line of related work is  Ollerer   Croux  
Loh   Tan   Chen et al    Tarr et al   
which studied the problem of robust precision matrix estimation in high dimensions under the  contamination
model 
In particular  under the cellwise contamination
model  Tarr et al    evaluated the performance of the
Glasso and CLIME estimators together with   Ustatistic
based robust covariance estimator for sparse precision matrix estimation  Under the same contamination model 
 Ollerer   Croux   provided an analysis for the robustness of these estimators in terms of breakdown behavior  Later on  from the point of statistical consistency 
Loh   Tan   established the statistical error bounds
for these estimators  However  these methods    Ollerer

depend on the speci   cellwise contamination structure
on the data matrix  Recently  inspired by Tukey   depth
estimator  Tukey    for vector estimation  Chen et al 
  introduced the concept of matrix depth and proposed   robust covariance matrix estimator using empirical depth function  They showed that their proposed estimator can achieve minimax optimal statistical rate under
Huber    contamination model  However  it is computationally very expensive to compute the deepest depth of  
matrix even in   moderate dimension  which makes such
method infeasible in the highdimensional regime 
All the aforementioned methods are limited to data with
heavy tails and outliers  Therefore  they are not suitable to
deal with data that are arbitrarily corrupted 

  Problem Setup and Estimation Method
In this section  we  rst introduce the setup of our problem 
then we present our proposed estimation method and hypothesis testing procedure 

  Problem Setup

Let                 Xd  be   ddimensional multivariate Gaussian random vector with zero mean and covariance matrix   It is associated with an undirected graph
           with vertex set                  corresponding to random variables and edge set                 
    jk     describing the connections of nodes  where
      is the precision matrix 
Suppose we have          observations            Xn  each
of which is drawn from the multivariate Gaussian distribution Nd    Let                 Xn    Rn   be the
data matrix and there may exist arbitrary corruption of the
data matrix    More speci cally  for each variable column
of data matrix    we allow at most    coordinates to be
arbitrarily corrupted  and we call this kind of corruption
model as the arbitrary corruption model  Note that under
the arbitrary corruption model  we do not require the corrupted entries lie in the same    rows  Clearly    special
case of the arbitrary corruption model is the outlier model
where the corruption appears in    observations  Under
the arbitrary corruption model     is the upper bound on
the number of corruptions for each variable  and under the
outlier model     is the upper bound on the number of outliers  Speci cally  under the outlier model  the set of row
indices              of the data matrix   is divided into two
disjoint subsets   and   with                 and
            XA denotes samples drawn from the authentic distribution  XO denotes samples that are outliers 
In general  there is no constraint on the type of corruptions
in our setting except an upper bound on the number of corruptions          For example  these corruptions could be
drawn from other distributions or even be deterministic 

  Estimation Method
Before we introduce our estimation method  we  rst introduce the truncated inner product which was proposed
by Chen et al    The truncated inner product hu  vin 
is de ned as follows  given two ndimensional vectors
       Rn  and the truncation number    satisfying
        we  rst compute the quantity qi   uivi  for
                 Then we sort  qi  
   and select the smallest         ones  Let   be the set of selected indices with
cardinality            then we have the truncated inner
product as hu  vin   Pi  qi 

The main idea of our estimation method is to use   robust
covariance matrix estimator which can mitigate the impact
of arbitrary corruptions  More speci cally  given   data matrix     Rn    which is arbitrarily corrupted  we obtain
the robust covariance matrix estimator    through   truncation procedure that each element   jk is calculated via
truncated inner product hX      kin    The motivation
of this truncation procedure is that the corrupted coordinates with large magnitude may heavily affect the precision
of our estimation results  and this simple truncation procedure can reduce such impact  Next  we introduce our robust
estimator  which is based on the robust covariance matrix
estimator and CLIME 
 Rd

     argmin
whereb  is the robust covariance matrix estimator obtained

through truncation      is   constraint parameter  We
refer to   as Robust CLIME  RCLIME  Note that here
we do not consider the Glasso type estimator since it requires the stringent incoherence condition on the covariance matrix to guarantee the model selection consistency 
Let         denote the ith column of   To estimate the precision matrix more ef ciently  instead of solving   we can estimate each column of   as follows

for                  and ei   Rd denotes   column vector that
the ith element is   and others are   Note that the combined solution         
   of   is equivalent to
the solution of    Cai et al    In addition  since
   is not symmetric  we need the following symmetrizab    arginf

tion procedure to get our robust estimator

         

where    
         Rd                  denotes
all       symmetric positive de nite matrices  The symmetrization procedure in   can be solved by the projected gradient descent method  and in practice  we can use

many simple symmetrization methods  such as the method
provided in Cai et al   
  Hypothesis Test
Based on the proposed robust estimator   we are interested in testing whether there is an edge between node  
and node   in GGMs  Jankova et al    Neykov et al 
  Gu et al    Xu et al    More speci cally 
we want to develop   procedure for the hypothesis test that
      jk     versus       jk     Let us assume that
the kth column of the precision matrix   to be the vector
         where   is the jth element of the vector    and     Rd  is the remaining    dimensional
vector  Thus it is equivalent to test the one dimensional
component            versus the nonrestricted alternative            In this case    are nuisance parameters  To this end  we  rst introduce the following estimation

 

assumption of the data  where          are the jth and kth columns of    and   respectively  We will show in

 

esis  Therefore  our asymptotic level  test is given by

the next section that the proposed debiased estimator    is
consistent to   and the test statistic bTn is asymptotically
normal pn                 under the null hypoth 
      
where          is the    quantile of the
standard normal distribution       Furthermore  we can
construct asymptotic level  con dence intervals of   as

if  bTn    
if  bTn      

  accept   
  reject   

    pn  Note that in practice  although we

have no idea about the exact upper bound on the number of
corruptions          we can use techniques such as crossvalidation to choose the best truncation number   
  Main Results
In this section  we present our main results and discuss connections with some related works  We start by stating some
assumptions  which are required in our analysis  We impose an important eigenvalue condition on the population
covariance matrix 
Assumption   There exist   constant     such that

         min     max       

  

This assumption can exclude singular or nearly singular covariance matrices  thus guarantee the uniqueness of  
In this paper  we consider the precision matrix   that

belongs to   class of matrices                     
Rd                    max   dPd
 ij  
      where       means   is positive de nite
and   corresponds to the row cardinality  Note that this
sparse precision matrix class has been previously considered in Cai et al    Liu   Wang   Zhao   Liu
  In addition  it immediately implies that   jk   
          where    is the jth column vector of  
Now  we are ready to provide our main results  The  rst
one characterizes the performance of our robust estimator
under the arbitrary corruption model  It shows that even
if the upper bound on the number of corruptions    scales
with pn  where   is the number of observations  our robust estimator can still recover the correct support  Note
that our results are derived under the arbitrary corruption
model  Since the outlier model is   special case of the arbitrary corruption model  our results can directly apply to the
outlier case 
Theorem   Under the arbitrary corruption model  suppose          and Assumption   is satis ed  In addition  assume the upper bound on the number of corruptions    satis es      apn for some constant       If

Furthermore  if the nonzero entries of   satisfy

then the Robust CLIME can correctly identify nonzero entries of  
Remark   According to   the estimation error of
our robust estimator consists of two terms  The  rst one

  splog      corresponds to the estimation error without

corruptions  The second extra term   sn  log      which
is linear in    is due to the effect of arbitrary corruption 
More speci cally  if there is no corruption in our data  then
the second term becomes zero since        Therefore  the

estimation error of our method reduces to   splog     

which matches the minimax optimal rate for sparse precision matrix estimation without corruptions in terms of
spectral norm  Yuan    Cai et al    Ravikumar
et al    In addition    in Theorem   indicates
that our robust estimator can correctly recover the support
of   even if the upper bound on the number of corrup 

tions    scales withpn  log    where   is the number of

observations  In addition  under the outlier model  this estimation result is comparable to the result provided by Yang
  Lozano   In their study  they proved that the proposed estimator can successfully recover the true parameter
provided that the upper bound of the number of outliers is
  pn  However  Yang   Lozano   does not consider the case when the data is arbitrarily corrupted 

Furthermore  if the upper bound on the number of corruptions    satis es      pn plog    our robust estimator
can achieve the same statistical rate as the standard estimator for Gaussian graphical models  This is summarized in
the following corollary 
Corollary   Under the same conditions of Theorem  
if we further assume that the upper bound on the number
of corruptions    satis es      pn plog    then for the
robust estimator    in   we have  with probability at
least          that

Furthermore  if the nonzero entries of   satisfy

kb               sr log  
    ij ij       plog     

min

 

 

then the Robust CLIME can correctly identify the nonzero
entries of  
Remark   Compared with Theorem   Corollary
  implies that under   slightly stricter condition on
the upper bound of the number of corruptions     
  pn plog    our robust estimator can successfully recover the true parameter   with guaranteed estimation

error   splog      Note that this error bound exactly

recover the spectral norm error bound for the case without
corruptions  Yuan    Cai et al    Ravikumar et al 
  which demonstrates the superiority of our estimator 

Next  we present the asymptotic results of our proposed test
statistics in   which veri es the effectiveness of our
testing procedure  Note that we consider the case that the
true observations are drawn from   Gaussian distribution 
Theorem   Suppose Assumption   is satis ed and

pn sM  plog           log           where
            If we choose regularization parameter satisfying     CM plog           log      then the test
statistic in   is asymptotically normal

Remark   Theorem   provides us an ef cient test
for the existence of an edge in GGMs  and gives us
an ef cient interval estimation of      ij 
In addition  Theorem   implies that if the upper bound on
the number of corruptions    satis es      pn plog  
and the quantity   is   constant  then the assumption
pn sM  plog           log           reduces
to   log   pn      which gives us the sparsity assumption that       pn log    This requirement on
sparsity matches the bestknown results for edge testing
in GGMs  Liu et al    Ren et al    More importantly  Theorem   suggests that even when     
  pn plog    out of   observations of each variable are
arbitrarily corrupted  our testing procedure is still ef cient

simulations to investigate the performance of our proposed
hypothesis testing procedure  Furthermore  we compare
our method with GLasso on   gene expression data 
  Synthetic Data
In our numerical simulations  we consider the following
two settings                  and  ii       
      We generate the true precision matrices based on
two graph structures  cluster and band  More speci cally 
the precision matrices   are generated by huge package 
and the magnitude of correlations is the default value  
in the huge generator  In order to incorporate corruptions 
we generate our observations by the following procedure 
For the arbitrary corruption model  we  rst generate the
  by   data matrix   from the Gaussian distribution
Nd    Then  for each column of the data matrix 
we let np coordinates be arbitrarily corrupted  where we
consider the corruption rate       for small number of
corruptions and       for large number of corruptions  In
addition  each corrupted coordinate is generated by normal
distributions       as follows 

   

                 

             

 

For the outlier model  we use the setup similar to Sun   Li
  Yang   Lozano   Speci cally  we generate
each observation from the mixture model as follows

Note that under both corruption models  we set the corIn other words  we choose

the number of corruptions to be   and   of all observations  This is due to the threshold of the number of
corruptions        pn  suggested in our theorem 
Point Estimation  We choose tuning parameters of each
method as follow  For tGLasso  we choose     from
    which is suggested by Yang   Lozano   For
RLL  we choose           which is suggested by Sun   Li   And for Robust CLIME  we
choose    around     Since the performance of   

 http cran rproject org web packages huge

Lasso is similar to tLasso  we just show the results of   
Lasso  All results we reported are their best performance
based on these parameters 
First  we use receiver operating characteristic  ROC 
curves to compare the overall performance of our method
with others in model selection over the full paths  For
the arbitrary corruption model  the ROC curves on cluster
graphs averaged over   simulations are shown in Figure  
We can observe that under the arbitrary corruption model 
as the number of corruptions increase  the advantage of our
approach becomes more signi cant  For the outlier model 
we also observe similar good performance of our method 
especially for outliers with large magnitude  Due to space
limit  the ROC curves for the outlier model can be found
in the longer version of this paper  These results indicate
that our method is very competitive in the graph recovery
problem with arbitrary corruptions 
Then  we evaluate the performance of our method and
some existing approaches in parameter estimation  For
model settings mentioned above  we choose the corruption
rate       for the purpose of comparisons  We generate   dataset as the training sample  and an independent
dataset from the same distribution as the test set  We set
        for tGLasso        for RLL  and      np
for Robust CLIME  We also choose the tuning parameter
  by grid search based on its performance on the training
sample and evaluate those estimators on the test set  Here

we use Spectral norm error kb    and Frobenius norm
error kb     kF to compare the performance of different

methods in parameter estimation  Tables   and   summarize estimation error results in term of Spectral norm averaged over   simulations  These results demonstrate the
advantage of our method in parameter estimation  Other
comparison results in terms of Frobenius norm error are
deferred to the longer version of this paper 
Hypothesis Test  We investigate the  nite sample performance of our proposed hypothesis testing procedure
through some simulation studies  We use the data generating process similar to Jankova et al    Neykov et al 
  and we consider the case that there are some corruptions in our data  More speci cally  for the aforementioned two settings  we consider the band graph structure
with band width   with the corresponding precision matrix   generated by   package huge  The magnitude
of correlations is the default value in the huge generator 
In order to incorporate corruptions  we use the same approach described above to generate observations  Speci 
cally  for the arbitrary corruption model  we generate samples through model    
  in   with         For
the outlier model  we generate samples through model    
 
in   with        
To check the validity of the type   error of our test  we run

  Gene Expression Data

In this subsection  we use the gene expression data of
Arabidopsis thaliana  which was analyzed by Wille et al 
  and later on by Finegold   Drton   Hirose  
Fujisawa   to illustrate the advantage of our method 
This data set includes       observations with   gene
expression levels  For this gene expression dataset  we preprocess it through   package limma  Figure   in Appendix illustrates the histogram of some rescaled gene expression data  It shows that some rescaled gene expressions
contain some expression levels with extreme large magnitude  which may be outliers  Therefore  we want to apply
our method to construct   network among these genes  For
Robust CLIME  we set        and adopt  fold crossvalidation to choose the tuning parameter  
The graph estimated by our method is given in Figure  
The dotted arrows and the solid undirected edges correspond to the known metabolic pathway and the graph estimated by Robust CLIME  respectively  We can see that our
approach identi es   similar graph to that obtained by previous analysis of Wille et al    but with fewer  crosstalk  edges between two pathways  For example  our approach  nds the important connection between AACT  and

 Available on http bioconductor org packages limma

the group MK  MPDC  and FFPS  in MAV pathway  And
in MEP path way  it also identi es the connection among
DXR  MCT  CMK and MECPS  Other methods such as
GLasso tends to estimate more links between two pathways
in order to identify these important relationships  These
edges between two pathways provided by GLasso might
be inaccurate relationships due to the lack of robustness 
The graph recovered by GLasso and the graph established
by Wille et al    can be found in the longer version of
this paper 
  Conclusions and Future Work
In this paper  for the Gaussian graphical model estimation
with arbitrary corruptions  we proposed   new estimator
for highdimensional precision matrices based on the robust covariance matrix estimator  We not only provide the
estimation error bound of our robust estimator  but also
propose   hypothesis testing procedure to assess the uncertainty of our robust estimator with corrupted observations 
and construct the con dence interval for the point estimate 
However  most of the robust high dimensional estimators
as well as our proposed estimator are not invariant under
the group action  Davies et al    Draisma et al   
we will study this problem in our future work
