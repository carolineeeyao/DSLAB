Abstract

Undirected graphical models or Markov random
 elds  MRFs  are widely used for modeling multivariate probability distributions  Much of the
work on MRFs has focused on continuous variables  and nominal variables  that is  unordered
categorical variables  However  data from many
real world applications involve ordered categorical variables also known as ordinal variables 
     movie ratings on Net ix which can be ordered from   to   stars  With respect to univariate ordinal distributions  as we detail in the
paper  there are two main categories of distributions  while there have been efforts to extend
these to multivariate ordinal distributions  the resulting distributions are typically very complex 
with either   large number of parameters  or with
nonconvex likelihoods  While there have been
some work on tractable approximations  these do
not come with strong statistical guarantees  and
moreover are relatively computationally expensive  In this paper  we theoretically investigate
two classes of graphical models for ordinal data 
corresponding to the two main categories of univariate ordinal distributions  In contrast to previous work  our theoretical developments allow
us to provide correspondingly two classes of estimators that are not only computationally ef cient
but also have strong statistical guarantees

variables  This conditional independence structure provides us with useful insights about how different variables
interact with each other  As   result MRFs are extensively
used in   variety of  elds  including Natural Language Processing  Manning   Sch utze    Biology  Friedman 
  and Medicine  Allen   Liu   
Popular parametric families in the general class of MRFs
are Gaussian graphical models  Speed   Kiiveri   
Rue   Held    for continuous  and bellshaped  data 
Ising and discrete graphical models  Ising    Jalali
et al    for nominal data  and mixed cases of these two
instances  Lauritzen   Wermuth    Yang et al   
However  variables that occur in many real world applications have ordered categorical scales  For example  in
medical data  diseases are graded from mild to fatal  severity of an injury is rated from mild injury to death  stages of
  disease is rated from   to III  Ordinal variables also occur
very commonly in data collected from surveys  For example  each subject taking   survey could be asked to respond
to   question using categories such as strongly disagree 
disagree  undecided  agree  strongly agree  These examples clearly show that ordinal data is pervasive in many real
world applications 
It will be instructive at this juncture to review univariate
distributions for ordinal data  which fall into two main categories  The  rst category of distributions consists of parameterizing various odds ratios involving the ordinal variable  and include the cumulative ratio  continuation ratio 
and consecutive ratio logit models  Armstrong   Sloan 
  Agresti    In practice  cumulative ratio and continuation ratio models are know to work better than the consecutive ratio model  McCullagh    and as   consequence  the consecutive ratio model is relatively less well
considered among these three models  Some generalizations of the above models have been considered in literature       Partial Proportional Odds model  Peterson  
Harrell Jr    which fall in between the simpler class
of models listed earlier and the multinomial logistic regression model in terms of their parametric complexity  but are
nonetheless not as popular as the simpler class of models 
The second category of univariate ordinal distributions are
based on the natural generative assumption that the ordinal variable is   quantization of   realvalued latent variable  Common distributions imposed on the latent variable

include the logistic distribution  in which case it reduces
to the classical cumulative ratio model  Agresti    as
well as the more popular standard normal distribution  in
which case it is called the ordered probit model  Becker  
Kennedy   
There has been some effort to construct multivariate ordinal distributions  and they again fall into two categories 
namely the multivariate extensions of the corresponding
two categories of univariate ordinal distributions 
In the
 rst category  there has been   line of work  see Bartolucci et al    and references therein  on designing
parametrized odds ratio based models  Bartolucci et al 
  provide   general framework for designing multivariate ordinal models by parameterizing marginal distributions using various odds ratios  However  the parametric
form of these models are complex  and have   large number of parameters  and so do not necessarily scale to highdimensional settings  Moreover  these models cannot be
readily expressed as graphical model distributions 
In the second category of multivariate ordinal distributions 
the ordinal random vector is modeled as   quantization of
  realvalued latent random vector  Here  the efforts have
focused on the use of the multivariate normal distribution
for the latent random vector  due plausibly to its more convenient mathematical nature  the resulting model is also
known as the multivariate probit model  Ashford   Sowden    Amemiya    But even with this modeling
assumption  the likelihood of the observed ordinal random
vector is not available in closedform  is considerably complex due to the presence   multidimensional integral  and
in particular is nonconvex  so that learning the model given
just the ordinal observations is typically computationally
intractable  Consequently Expectation Maximization  EM 
and approximate EM based approaches  Chib   Greenberg    Guo et al    have been proposed to compute the Maximum Likelihood Estimate  MLE    caveat
with these is that they do not come with statistical guarantees  and moreover  as our experiments show  are still
computationally expensive  Because of the computational
intractability of the MLE  alternative approaches have been
proposed which maximize the pairwise  composite likelihood of the data  which involve only the univariate and bivariate marginals  Lindsay    De Leon    Han  
Pan    Another class of methods have been proposed
which estimate the model parameters in multiple stages
 Muth en      oreskog    unlike the previous approaches which estimate all the parameters using   single
estimating equation  Although these approaches are computationally very ef cient they do not provide consistent
estimates in high dimensional settings 
Thus  in spite of the ubiquity of multivariate ordinal data 
there have been limited popular applications of these mul 

tivariate ordinal distributions to model such data  particularly in highdimensional settings  with   large number of
ordinal variables 
In this paper  we develop multivariate ordinal graphical
model distributions  for which the estimators are computationally tractable  Following the development of classical univariate ordinal distributions  our investigations fall
into two categories 
In the  rst category  we investigate
multivariate extensions of the logodds parameterized univariate ordinal distributions  Towards this  we leverage the
line of work in Yang et al    which provides   mechanism to extend   univariate distribution to   multivariate
graphical model distribution  by using the univariate distributions to specify nodeconditional distributions  Their
theoretical treatment requires the univariate distributions to
belong to exponential families  while as we show  the logodds based univariate ordinal distributions  namely cumulative and continuation ratio models  Agresti    do not
belong to exponential families  Could perhaps the framework of Yang et al    be nonetheless be extended to
this case  We provide   de nitive answer in the negative 
and show that using these univariate ordinal distributions as
nodeconditional distributions cannot lead to   consistent
joint distribution  Whereas  the consecutive ratio model
 Agresti    does belong to the exponential family  and
can be extended to   multivariate graphical model distribution  However  as we will demonstrate in our experiments  this resulting novel class of consecutive ratio MRFs
has mixed empirical results 
In the second category  we investigate the multivariate extensions of latent variable quantization based univariate ordinal distributions  We focus on the case where the latent
random vector is multivariate Gaussian  Here  we leverage
the structure of the ordinal data  and provide   very simple multistage estimator along the lines of Muth en  
  oreskog   that  nesses computing the likelihood 
and accordingly is computationally tractable  but interestingly  also comes with strong statistical guarantees  We
corroborate our  ndings on both simulated and real data 

  Multivariate Odds Ratio based Models
In the  rst part of the paper  we investigate the approach
of Yang et al         specifying nodeconditional
distributions via classical univariate ordinal distributions 
and then exploring the corresponding joint distribution via
HammersleyClifford esque analyses 

  MRFs via Univariate Latent Quantized Ordinal

Models

The most popular class of univariate ordinal distributions
rely on   generative model that quantizes   latent variable 

Ordinal Graphical Models    Tale of Two Approaches

Suppose we have   realvalued latent random variable    
  with CDF denoted by                    where  
is   location parameter of the distribution  Suppose that the
ordinal random variable                  can be written
as   discretized version of the realvalued variable    as
iff            for some location  or cutY     
point  parameters     
   and with          
  It then follows that the probability mass function of the
ordinal variable   can be written as

  MRFs via Continuation Ratio Models
One modi cation to the cumulative ratio model that has
been considered in the literature is that of   closely re 

                 This class
lated logodds ratio  log         
of univariate ordinal distributions are also called continuation ratio models  From the logodds ratio above  denoting
            the Probability Mass Function  PMF  of the
random variable   can be derived as

                             

 
  popular distribution for the latent realvalued variable
  is the univariate logistic distribution  where    
logistic    so that the function    above is the logistic
function                   exp    In this case  the
distribution above can also be expressed in   more compact
form in terms of logodds ratios as  log         
             

   Suppose that for each         we have

Accordingly  this class of ordinal distributions are also
called cumulative ratio models  We now consider the general framework of Yang et al    of using univariate
ordinal distribution in   to specify nodeconditional distributions  and deriving   consistent joint distribution 
Let                 Yp  be   pdimensional ordinal random
vector  To simplify the notation  in the sequel we assume
that the domains of all the random variables  Ys  
   are
same and equal to                Let            be  
graph with nodes corresponding to each of the random variables  Ys  
  Ys                                              
 
where the location parameter         is an arbitrary function of the rest of the variables and   is the logistic function  We now present the following theorem which shows
that these nodeconditional distributions do not lead to  
consistent joint distribution 
Theorem   Consider   pdimensional random vector
                Yp  with domain                  And let
           be   graph with nodes corresponding to each
of the random variables  Ys  
   Suppose that all nodeconditional distributions of this random vector follow the
univariate cumulative ratio model in   where for each
        the location parameter         is an arbitrary
function of the rest of the variables 
Then  for       there exist real valued parameters
               for which the speci ed nodeconditional
distributions are not consistent with any joint distribution
over   that is Markov with respect to the graph   with
factors of size at most  

The proof of the above theorem can be found in Appendix
  and follows the Hammersley Clifford type analysis of

As in the previous section  given this univariate ordinal distribution  we ask if we could employ the strategy of Yang
et al    of using these to specify nodeconditional
distributions  and deriving   consistent joint distribution 
Speci cally  suppose that for each node       we have
     exp

where                            and the location parameter         is an arbitrary function of the rest of the
variables  The following theorem shows that these node
conditional distributions do not lead to   consistent joint
distribution  The proof of this theorem is provided in Appendix   
Theorem   Consider   pdimensional random vector
                Yp  with domain                  And let
           be   graph with nodes corresponding to each
of the random variables  Ys  
   Suppose that all nodeconditional distributions of this random vector follow the
univariate continuation ratio model in   where for each
        the location parameter         is an arbitrary
function of the rest of the variables 
Then  for       there exist real valued parameters
               for which the speci ed nodeconditional
distributions are not consistent with any joint distribution
over   that is Markov with respect to the undirected graph
  

  MRFs via   Consecutive Ratio model
  key caveat with the univariate cumulative and continuation ratio models is that they do not belong to exponential families  and in particular do not possess the regularities that allow for existence of consistent joint given
nodeconditionals belonging to these distributions  We
now consider the third class of univariate ordinal distribu

tions called consecutive ratio model which is de ned as 

log         

                 for                    

As we show below  this ordinal distribution belongs to an
exponential family  unlike ordinal distributions in earlier
sections 
Proposition   The consecutive ratio model for an ordinal random variable                  belongs to an exponential family with suf cient statistics            
    
                    where as be 

        exp PM 

fore              for                    
We now consider the counterpart of our key question in
the earlier sections  Suppose we use the univariate ordinal
distribution above to specify nodeconditional distributions
for an ordinal random vector               Yp  Speci 
cally  suppose that for each node         we have
           Ys     

  Ys        exp    Xj 

 

where                       for                     where
the location parameter         is an arbitrary function of
the rest of the variables  Since these nodeconditional distributions belong to   univariate exponential family  an application of Proposition   of Yang et al    yields the
following theorem 
Theorem   The nodeconditional distributions in  
are consistent with   joint distribution that is Markov
with respect
to an undirected graph           
which in the pairwise case with factors of size atmost two necessarily has the following form        
exp Ps               Ys           EPj     
 st   Ys       Yt     

The distribution in Theorem   can be rewritten in the following equivalent form

       exp  Xs       
       

 st     Ys     Yt 

       Ys       

 

Note that the pairwise interaction terms in the above distri 

bution utilize the ordinality of   through the term    
Ys     Yt 
To estimate the parameters of the consecutive ratio model
  we solve the following regularized node conditional
log likelihood maximization problem at each node

We brie   note that existing results on statistical guarantees for estimators of exponential family graphical models  Yang et al    Tansey et al    carry over to the
consecutive ratio model 
Contrast with Discrete Nominal Graphical models  We
now contrast the consecutive ratio model in   with the
classical discrete nominal graphical model which treats the
random variables at each node as nominal variables  Consider the following discrete graphical model over the random vector   

       exp  Xs       

       Ys     

          Xj     

 st jk   Ys       Yt     

 

Unlike the consecutive ratio model 
the above model
doesn   have   common edge parameter  st for different
values of Ys  Yt  Each edge in the categorical model is
parametrized using     variables  As   result this model
does not utilize the ordinality of   and is also more complex compared to the consecutive ratio model  While
this parameterization does encompass the consecutive ratio model parameterization  the key disadvantage is that the
nominal graphical model has   larger number of parameters
and hence greater sample complexity 

  Multivariate Latent Quantized Models
In the previous section we considered using the mechanism
of Yang et al    to directly construct multivariate ordinal graphical models from univariate ordinal distributions 
In this section we revisit the classical and most popular
class of univariate ordinal distributions based on the quantization of   realvalued latent variable    natural class of
multivariate distributions can be obtained by taking   multivariate latent random vector  and quantizing this to obtain
  multivariate ordinal random vector 

  Probit Graphical Model
The most popular instance of such multivariate quantized
ordinal distributions is the case where the multivariate latent random vector is multivariate Gaussian  which is also
known as the multivariate probit model  Ashford   Sowden    Amemiya    Thus the dependencies are all
represented in the latent random vector via the underlying
Gaussian distribution 
In the probit model 
the ordinal random vector    
          Yp  is assumed to be generated from   latent multivariate Gaussian random vector                 Zp  where

         and Zi                  Each Yi
is obtained through discretization of Zi as follows  Yi  
    where

  ESTIMATION OF POLYCHORIC CORRELATIONS

AND LATENT GRAPH STRUCTURE

In

We present   two step approach for estimation of

the joint distribution of random variables Zj  Zk is bivari

If   is known  then one could estimate the unknown parameter  jk by maximizing the bivariate marginal log likelihood function  which has the following form

where     off is the elementwise   norm excluding diagonal entries  It can be seen that the objective is nonconvex 
and intractable to optimize in general  Accordingly  approximate EM based approaches  Chib   Greenberg   
Guo et al    have been proposed for learning the model
parameters  but these are still relatively computationally
demanding  and also do not come with the strong statistical
guarantees of the actual regularized MLE solutions 

    Direct Estimation Method
In the second contribution of the paper  we propose an alternative procedure for the estimation of the unknown parameters     in the probit graphical model distribution in  
This is   two stage procedure where in the  rst stage we estimate the thresholds    from the univariate marginals and
in the second stage we estimate the polychoric correlations 
  from bivariate marginal distributions

  Theoretical Properties
In this section  we show that the direct estimation method
we proposed in Section   is not just simple but has strong
statistical guarantees 
Speci cally  we provide an  
its sparsistency with respect to graphical model structure
recovery  For simplicity  we assume that   is given  However  extension to the case where   is unknown should be
fairly straightforward 
We begin with introducing some notation  Let        
  where   denotes the Kronecker matrix product  denote
the Hessian of   log det    evaluated at   Let   be
the set of indices corresponding to all nonzero entries in
  and Sc be the complement of    We also de ne

simplicity where   denotes the maximum absolute row
sum of matrix  Let   be the maximum nodedegree in the
latent graph  Finally  let  jk        jk    be the
population version of the sample loss de ned in Equation
  We now state our assumptions 
    There exists
 ScS SS         
    There is   constant     such that  jk

            Moreover 
 ab jk    is strictly positive             
such that          ab jk       
    The absolute value of the  st   nd and  rdorder
derivatives of  ab jk             are upperbounded
respectively by                  Furthermore 
the mild regularity property that  jk    not have degenerate critical points in             holds 
    is the standard incoherence assumption that is made
for the guarantees of glasso estimator  Ravikumar et al 
      is   mild condition which ensures that no two
latent variables are perfectly collinear and all the categories
of the ordinal variables have non zero probabilities 
Theorem   Consider our estimator   for solving   latent Gaussian model with true parameter   And suppose

  Experiments
In this section we present the performance of Consecutive
Ratio model  Consec model  and our estimator for probit
model  ProbitDirect  on various synthetic and real world
datasets 

  Synthetic Experiments
Baselines  In the synthetic experiments we compare our
estimators with the following estimators 
   ProbitEM  EM MCMC based estimator for probit
model described in Guo et al    This uses MCMC
sampling to approximate the Estep 
   ProbitEMApprox  Approximate EM based estimator for
probit model proposed by Guo et al    This approach
uses mean  eld approximation in the Estep to speed up the
EM procedure 
   Discrete model  This model ignores the order in the categories and treats each ordinal variable as   nominal variable  Here we restrict ourselves to   pairwise model  To
learn this model we use the pseudolikelihood based estimator of Jalali et al   
   Oracle  When the data is generated from   probit model 
we also compare with an oracle estimator which has access
to the latent variables of the model  Here we run glasso on
the latent variables to estimate the graph structure 
Model Selection  The best tuning parameter for all the estimators described above is selected using   fold cross validation  For ProbitEMApprox we use the cross validation
technique proposed in  Guo et al    For ProbitEM 
Discrete model  Consec model and Oracle we use the standard cross validation technique where we pick the best tuning parameter based on log likelihood on validation set  For
ProbitDirect we use the following kfold cross validation

be the covariance matrix output by Step   of ProbitDirect 
when trained using all the subsets except ith subset  And
let    be the raw estimate obtained from Step   of ProbitDirect  using ith subset  We pick     which maximizes the

samples  we do not compare with Discrete model  Consec
model because computation of likelihood for these models
is infeasible  For comparison on these three metrics  we
select the best tuning parameter for each of the methods

ure   shows the results obtained using      
More results for large   and grid and random graphs can be
found in Appendix    We can seen that ProbitDirect and
ProbitEM have similar performance  However  ProbitDirect is   orders of magnitude faster than ProbitEM  ProbitEMApprox has very poor performance  especially in low
sample complexity setting  This could be because of the
mean  eld approximation that is made by Guo et al   

where in the Estep they approximate   ZjZk         as
  Zj             Zk         This decouples the interactions between any two random variables  Also note that
ProbitDirect is     times faster than ProbitEMApprox  See

Figure   The estimated latent graph structure corresponding to
SmokeNow and sociodemographic indicators  The graph is generated from the marginal distribution of the corresponding variables  Green and red edges represent positive and negative partial
correlations respectively  Edge thickness is proportional to the
magnitude of the partial correlation 

  DATA FROM CONSECUTIVE RATIO MODEL
In this experiment we sample data from Consec model  Figures     present the results on   grid graph along with
the details of exact parameters used  When the interaction
between variables is low  Consec model has similar performance as other estimators  Figure   However  when
the interactions are high  Figure   its performance degrades  We noticed similar poor performance of Consec
model on other graphs  This could suggest that either the
node conditional likelihood based estimator for Consecutive Ratio model is not ef cient or latent graphical models
such as Probit model are better models than Consecutive
Ratio model 

  Health Information National Trends Survey study
The Health Information National Trends Survey  HINTS 
is   nationally representative survey conducted by the National Cancer Institute  NCI  every few years  In this work
we analyze HINTSFDA data which is   special data col 

lected by NCI in partnership with the Food and Drug Administration  FDA  and is made publicly available by NCI 
This survey collected detailed information on the following topics  Tobacco Product Use  Beliefs about Tobacco
Products  Beliefs About Cancer  How people access Health
Information  Socio Demographic Indicators  The survey
has   respondents on     questions  Almost all the
questions in the survey have either ordinal or categorical
responses  Refer to Appendix   for summary statistics of
the data and details about preprocessing performed on the
data  We treat each question in the survey as   node in the
graph and responses of individuals to these questions as
samples drawn from the graph  We selected   questions
from the dataset  that are relevant for our analysis  We   
the probit model using ProbitDirect on the selected questions  To choose the best tuning parameter we use   fold
cross validation  We obtain   con dence intervals for
the edge strengths of the latent graph through jackknife resampling technique  We place an edge in the graph only if
its con dence interval doesn   intersect with    
Figure   shows how various variables related to sociodemographic indicators are associated with smoking behavior of   person  In particular  it shows that SmokeNow has
  very signi cant association with Education  This indicates that if   person is well educated then conditioned on
all the other variables  there is lower chance that the person smokes  In Appendix    we provide an additional Figure   which shows how the perceptions of smoking risks
vary with smoking behavior  It shows that SmokeNow and
FewCigarettesHarmHealth have   positive partial correlation  indicating that conditioned on the rest of the variables 
people who smoke  perceive smoking as less harmful than
people who don   smoke  Table   in Appendix   describes
some highly relevant nodes in the learned graphs  from
which several other insights can be obtained  We believe
these insights can be helpful in designing ef cient strategies for communicating smoking related health information
to the public
