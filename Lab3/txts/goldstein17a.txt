Convex Phase Retrieval without Lifting via PhaseMax

Abstract

Semide nite relaxation methods transform   variety of nonconvex optimization problems into
convex problems  but square the number of variables  We study   new type of convex relaxation
for phase retrieval problems  called PhaseMax 
that convexi es the underlying problem without
lifting  The resulting problem formulation can
be solved using standard convex optimization
routines  while still working in the original  lowdimensional variable space  We prove  using   random spherical distribution measurement model 
that PhaseMax succeeds with high probability for
  suf ciently large number of measurements  We
compare our approach to other phase retrieval
methods and demonstrate that our theory accurately predicts the success of PhaseMax 

  Introduction
Semide nite relaxation is the technique of replacing   broad
range of nonconvex optimization problems involving   vector of  possibly discrete  variables with convex problems
involving matrices  The relaxed convex problem is then
solved to global optimality  and the solution is used to extract   global minimizer of the original nonconvex problem 
Unfortunately  convexity comes at   steep cost  semide nite
relaxation squares the dimensionality of the problem  resulting in formulations that are convex but computationally
intractable in many situations  In fact  the increase in dimensionality  which is called lifting  often prevents the use
of this technique in machine learning and computer vision
applications involving thousands to millions of variables 
This article studies convex relaxation for phase retrieval 
  canonical nonconvex problem that can be solved via
semide nite relaxation  We present   relaxation approach
that convexi es the problem without lifting       it solves
the problem in its original  lowdimensional space

  Phase Retrieval Problems
Phase retrieval deals with the recovery of an ndimensional
signal      Hn  with   either   or    from      
magnitude measurements of the form  Cand es et al   

bi    cid ai    cid 

                  

 

where ai   Hn  and                   are the  known  measurement vectors  Because of the nonlinearity caused by
measuring the magnitude of the linear terms in   the phase
retrieval problem is nonconvex 
  variety of algorithms exist for  nding    in   Classical
methods  such as the GerchbergSaxton and Feinup algorithms  search for   solution via alternating leastsquares
steps that are ef cient when the measurement ensemble  ai 
forms   tight frame         collection of Fourier matrices 
More recently  there has been signi cant interest in convex methods for phase retrieval that provably  nd global
solutions without the danger of getting trapped in local minima  These methods  including PhaseLift  Cand es et al 
  and its dual formulation PhaseCut  Waldspurger et al 
  rely on semide nite relaxation and replace the unknown ndimensional vector   with    much larger       
matrix of unknowns that is recovered using semide nite
programming  While such methods come with strong theoretical guarantees and do not get trapped in local minima 
they require lifting  semide nite relaxation squares the number of unknowns  which makes this approach intractable
for realworld image processing applications involving thousands or millions of variables  As   result  there has been
   urry of interest in global convergence properties of nonconvex solvers that operate in the original feature space 
such as the methods in  Netrapalli et al    Schniter  
Rangan    Cand es et al    Chen   Cand es   
Wang et al    While these methods come with theoretical guarantees  nonconvexity makes it dif cult to combine
them with commonly used regularizers  and typically precludes the use of sophisticated optimization methods that
can handle constraints  nondifferentiable terms  etc 
We note that the PhaseMax formulation has also been proposed by  Bahmani   Romberg    and was recently
analyzed by  Hand   Voroninski    We discuss and
compare these results in Section

where            is either the real or complex numbers 
  Proposed Relaxation
We propose PhaseMax    formulation of the phase retrieval
problem that avoids lifting  Put simply  PhaseMax relaxes
the nonconvex equality constraints  cid ai    cid    bi into convex inequality constraints of the form  cid ai    cid    bi  The
resulting convex problem can then be solved using linear
programming in the real case or using secondorder cone
programming in the complex case 
At  rst glance  the proposed relaxation seems too simplistic
to recover    Indeed  the relaxed system of inequalities
has   trivial solution 
the allzeros vector  To obtain  
meaningful solution  we need to force the solution vector to
lie on the boundary of the constraint set  where the inequality
constraints hold with equality  To force the solution to lie on
the boundary  we rely on some intelligent  guess       Hn
of the solution to   we will discuss methods for producing
such guesses in Section   We then  nd the feasible point
that lies as far in the direction of      Hn as possible  This
results in the convex optimization problem

  Hn

 PhaseMax 

maximize
subject to  cid ai    cid    bi                  
The key idea behind PhaseMax is that the objective forces
the solution vector to lie along the boundary of the constraint
set  where the constraints are active  Evidently  if all of the
constraints are active at this solution  then we have recovered
  solution to the original nonconvex problem  
Quite surprisingly  the PhaseMax relaxation provably recovers the true solution to   in many situations  In particular 
we have the following main result 
Theorem   Consider the case of recovering   signal
    Hn from   measurements of the form   with measure

and uniformly from the unit sphere  Let

be the angle between the true vector    and the  guess

that measures the accuracy of our guess  If        then

whenever             the probability that PhaseMax
recovers the true signal    is at least

Similar results for the real case are derived below 

  Formulation using Geometric Probability
Conditions for which PhaseMax enables exact recovery
can be formulated as   classical problem from geometric
probability involving random hemispheres  or  caps  We
begin with   few simple de nitions  Recall that we use
to denote the unit sphere embedded in Hn  Given  
    
 
vector         

    the hemisphere cap centered at   is
CH              

   cid     cid cid     

is said to be aligned with         
 

we will often consider the set  ai     sign cid 

 
This cap contains all vectors that form an acute angle with   
We also need the concept of aligned vectors    complex
vector         
if
 
 cid      cid      
    In words  two vectors are aligned if their
inner product is real valued and nonnegative  Given  
vector   and   measurement vector    we have  cid ai    cid   
 cid ai    cid  for any unitmagnitude        For this reason 
of measurement vectors aligned with    without loss of
generality  Note that replacing  ai  with  ai  in PhaseMax
does not change the feasible set  and thus does not impact
the recovered solution  Finally  observe that   solution   cid  to
 PM  must be aligned with     This is because  cid   cid     cid   
 cid   cid     cid  when     sign cid   cid     cid    It follows that   cid  cannot
be optimal unless sign cid   cid     cid     
We are now ready to formulate the following exact recovery
condition for PhaseMax 
Theorem   Consider the recovery of   vector    using
PhaseMax with guess     Assume  without loss of generality 
that    and the measurement ensemble  ai  are aligned
with    Let          cid     cid      
    be the set of unit
vectors aligned with     Then     is the unique solution of
PhaseMax if

Proof  Suppose the conditions of this theorem hold  and
let   cid  be   solution to  PM  Since    is in the feasible
set    cid  must produce an objective value at least as large as
   and so  cid   cid     cid     cid       cid  We know that   cid  is aligned
with     Since    is assumed to be aligned with     the vector
      cid       is also aligned with     and satis es

 cid     cid     cid   cid     cid     cid       cid     

Since   cid  is   feasible solution for  PM  we have

 cid ai        cid     cid ai    cid 

 cid ai    cid cid ai   cid cid     cid ai   cid      

 
    and ai is aligned with   

       

Now  recall that  cid ai    cid      
Hence  we get

 cid ai   cid cid     

 
 cid ai   cid         

 

If  cid cid      then we see from   that the unitlength vector      cid cid  satis es    cid    ai    which contradicts
the covering condition   It follows that  cid cid      and
  cid      

  Sphere Covering Results
Theorem   states that exact recovery of    occurs when
the measurement ensemble  ai  is aligned with    and the
set   is covered by the caps  CH ai  We now study the
probability that this condition holds  To do so  we need  
few elementary sphere covering results  Our proof builds
on the following simple result 
    Rn using
Lemma   Suppose we slice the sphere     
  planes through the origin  Then we divide the sphere into

Lemma   appears to have been  rst proved by  Schl     
  and simple induction arguments can be found in
 Wendel    Gilbert      uredi   
Before we attack the problem of when   holds  we begin
with   simpler question   how often is   sphere covered
by caps with centers chosen at random from the sphere 
This question has been studied in detail by Gilbert  Gilbert 
  in the case       For our purposes  we need to study
the covering probability in the more general case when caps
are only chosen from   subset of the sphere  and the sphere
can have arbitrarily high dimension  We show below that
calculating this probability is easy when the caps are chosen
from   symmetric subset of the sphere  We say that the set
  is symmetric if  for all        we also have        
  probability measure de ned over   is symmetric if the
measure of   is the same as    for every       
Lemma   Consider some nonempty symmetric set

This is the probability of getting   or more heads when

Proof  Let    cid    be   collection of          vectors sampled
from   using   symmetric measure  De ne ai   cia cid   
where  ci  are        Bernoulli variables that take value

Proof  The proof is by induction  As   base case  we have
           and            for       Now suppose
we have   sphere     
in   dimensions sliced by      
planes into             original  regions  Consider the
effect of adding   kth plane  pk  The number of new regions
created is equal to the number of original regions that are
intersected by pk  To count the number of new regions  we
project the       original normal vectors into pk  and count
the minimal number of regions formed inside pk by the
resulting projected planes  which is at most              
Adding this to the number of original regions yields
                                    

We leave it to the reader to verify that   satis es this
recurrence relation 

which contains all points not covered by the caps  CR ai 
The caps  CR ai  cover the sphere whenever the intersection   is empty  There are  mA such intersections that
 cid 
can be formed  one for each choice of the sequence  ci 
Now  from Lemma   we know that the mA random planes
   cid ai    cid     
nonempty regions  Each of these regions corresponds to the
intersection   for one possible choice of  ci  Therefore 
of the  mA possible intersections  at most      mA  of them
are nonempty  Since each intersection is equally likely  the
probability of covering the sphere is at least

 cid  divide the sphere into at most      mA

Remark 
It can be shown that the bound in Lemma  
is tight exact when the slicing planes are chosen from  
continuous probability distribution  Similarly  the bound
in Lemma   is exact when the set  ai  is sampled from  
continuous distribution over   
We are now ready to present our main result  Exact recovery
theorems for PhaseMax will follow immediately from the
following geometric theorem  The result considers the case
where the measurement vectors are drawn from only one
hemisphere

Proof  To simplify notation  we assume                     
Because of rotational symmetries this does not change the

the mapping ai     cid   onto and  piecewise  isometric  and

nearby cap CR    To justify this claim  suppose that  
holds  Choose some     CR    This point is covered by
some cap CR ai  with ai      If  cid ai    cid      then ai     cid

Note we have used the fact that  cid    cid  is realvalued and nonnegative because     CR    We have also used  cid ai    cid

We can now see that the probability that CR

pcover              mA  denote the probability of covering
     conditioned on the number mA of points lying in

pcover mA     As noted in Lemma   this is the chance of

of the unit sphere that lies either above or below both planes

heads count is half the probability of it lying in    or

  Recovery Guarantees for PhaseMax
Using the covering result of Lemma   together with the
covering formulation of the exact recovery condition  
proving exact recovery of PhaseMax is now rather straightforward  We begin with the realvalued case 
Theorem   Consider the case of recovering   realvalued
signal      Rn from   measurements of the form   with
       and uniform vectors  ai       
  PhaseMax recovers
the true signal    with probability at least

  angle        and             

where          
Proof  Consider the set of   independent and uniformly
sampled measurements  ai       
   The aligned vec 
  
tors  ai   phase cid ai    cid ai  are uniformly distributed
over the half sphere CR    Exact reconstruction happens
when the condition in Lemma   holds  To bound this probability  we invoke Lemma   with        and        

 

We have an analogous result in the complex case 
Theorem   Consider the case of recovering   complexvalued signal      Rn from   measurements of the form
  PhaseMax
  with        and uniform vectors  ai       
 cid 
recovers the true signal    with probability at least

where          
Proof  Let  ai     phase cid ai    cid ai  be aligned measurement vectors  De ne the half sphere of aligned ascent
directions

By Lemma   PhaseMax recovers    if

Let us bound the probability of this event  Consider the
set        cid    cid cid      We now claim that   holds
whenever

To prove this claim  consider some     DC  To keep notation light  we will assume without loss of generality that
 cid   cid      Form the vector  cid          cid    cid cid     which
is the projection of   onto    Suppose now that   holds 
Since  cid    CC         there is some   with  cid    CC ai 
But then

 
 

     cid cid   ai cid cid     cid   ai cid cid     cid   cid    cid cid      ai cid cid 

that

   cid   ai cid cid 
We have used the fact
 cid   cid    cid cid      ai cid   
  cid    cid cid cid ai    cid  which is imaginary valued and thus has
no real component  We see that     CC ai  and the claim
is proved 
We now know that exact reconstruction happens whenis
ever condition   holds  Note that the sphere Sn 
  and the set   is isomorphic to the
isomorphic to     
sphere     
  The aligned vectors  ai  are uniformly distributed over   half sphere in CC         which is isomor 
  The probability of
phic to the upper half sphere in     
these vectors covering the cap CC        is thus given by
pcover                  from Lemma   which is at least

We can simplify this by using the fact that       We
also throw away the small constants in the numerator and
denominator  which weakens the bound very slightly but
tidies up the result 

  Experiments and Discussion
  Initialization Methods

  variety of methods exist for generating the initial
guess    The simplest approach is to use   random vector  see  Goldstein   Studer    for   corresponding
analysis and exact recovery proof in this case    more powerful method is the truncated spectral initializer  Chen

such initializers is provided in  Lu   Li    As proved
in Prop    of  Chen   Cand es    for any      
there is   constant    such that  with probability exceeding

This motivates the following process that recovers    using
  number of measurements that grows linearly with    First 
choose some       and calculate   from   Next 
generate   spectral initializer    using    random Gaussian
measurements  This initializer has accuracy   with high
probability  Finally  using      the constant in this expression must be larger than   to guarantee recovery with high
probability  additional random Gaussian measurements  recover the vector    using PhaseMax  This recovery step
succeeds with high probability when   is large  This process recovers    using         measurements  which is
linear in    For   more detailed analysis with no unspeci ed
constants  see  Goldstein   Studer   
  simpler recovery approach only samples max     
measurements  and then uses the same set of measurements
for both the initialization and recovery  This process works
well in practice  and is used in the experiments below  Technically  our results assume the measurements  ai  are independent of     and so our theory does not formally guarantee
convergence in this case  For an analysis that considers
the case where  ai  and    are dependent  we refer to the
analysis in  Bahmani   Romberg

We compare PhaseMax with other recovery methods  including lifted convex methods and nonconvex approaches

to achieve exact recovery with   probability  of various
phase retrieval methods as   function of the number of un 

knowns    We also list the probability of reconstruction
from   measurements  We see that PhaseMax requires the
same sample complexity       as compared to PhaseLift 
TWF  and TAW  when used together with the truncated spectral initializer proposed in  Cand es   Li   
The recovery bounds for all other methods require unspeci ed constants  ci in Table   that are generally extremely
large and require   lower bound on the initialization accuracy  In contrast  the bounds for PhaseMax contain no unspeci ed constants  explicitly depend on the approximation
factor   and our new analytical approach yields extremely
sharp bounds  see below for the details 
We also compare in Table   to   different analysis of the
PhaseMax formulation by  Bahmani   Romberg    that
appeared shortly before our own  and to   later analysis by
 Hand   Voroninski    By using methods from machine learning theory   Bahmani   Romberg    produce
exact reconstruction bounds that  for   speci ed value of  
are uniform with respect to the initialization     and thus
guarantee exact signal recovery in the case that    is dependent on the measurement vectors  The analysis presented
here is weaker in the sense that is does not have this uniformity property  but stronger in the sense that it produces
tighter bounds without unspeci ed constants  The bounds
by  Hand   Voroninski    require unspeci ed constants 
but the authors show that PhaseMax can be analyzed using
standard concentration of measure arguments 

  Tightness of Guarantees

By using strong concentration bounds for the unit sphere 
our analysis produces sharp recovery guarantees that lie
close to behavior observed in practice  In Figure   we use
random Gaussian test problems and the accelerated gradientbased solver described in  Goldstein et al    to plot
the empirical and theoretical probabilities of exact signal
recovery for       and       measurements while
varying the accuracy     angle       of the initial guess

Figure   Comparison between the empirical success probability  solid lines  and our theoretical lower bound  dashed lines  for varying
angles   between the true signal and the approximation vector  Our theoretical results accurately characterize the empirical success
probability of PhaseMax  Furthermore  PhaseMax exhibits   sharp phase transition for larger dimensions 

We declared exact recovery when the relative error of the
recovered signal fell below  
Our theoretical bounds tend to agree fairly closely with
observations  and generally require fewer than   more
measurements than is needed in practice  We also observe
  sharp phase transition between inaccurate and accurate
recovery  as predicted by our theory 

  Performance Limits of PhaseMax

To compare PhaseMax to other phase retrieval methods  we
observe the accuracy of signal reconstruction as   function
of the number of measurements  We emphasize that this
comparison is only done in the random Gaussian problem
setting  and results may differ with different types of signal 
measurement  and noise models  The sole purpose of this
experiment is to explore the ef cacy and limits of PhaseMax 
and to test the tightness of the predicted recovery guarantees 
For an extensive comparison between existing methods  see
 Waldspurger et al    Jaganathan et al    We compare the GerchbergSaxton algorithm  Gerchberg   Saxton 
  the Fienup algorithm  Fienup    the truncated
Wirtinger  ow  Chen   Cand es    and PhaseMax  All
methods were initialized using the truncated spectral initializer  Chen   Cand es   
We also run simulations using the semide nite relaxation
method PhaseLift  Cand es et al    implemented using  
proximal gradient solver  PhaseLift  and its equivalent dual
formulation PhaseCut  Waldspurger et al    is the only
convex alternative to PhaseMax  However  unlike PhaseMax  PhaseLift PhaseCut  lifts  the problem to   higher

dimension and squares the number of unknowns 
Figure   reveals that PhaseMax requires larger oversampling ratios     to enable faithful signal recovery compared to nonconvex phaseretrieval algorithms that operate in the original signal dimension  This is because the
truncated spectral initializer requires oversampling ratios
of about six or higher to yield suf ciently accurate approximation vectors    that enable PhaseMax to succeed 
While PhaseMax does not achieve exact reconstruction with
the lowest number of measurements  it is convex  operates
in the original signal dimension  can be implemented via
solvers for Basis Pursuit  and comes with sharp performance guarantees that do not sweep constants under the rug
 cf  Figure  
The convexity of PhaseMax enables   natural extension
to sparse phase retrieval  Jaganathan et al    Shechtman et al    or other signal priors       total variation 
group sparsity  or bounded in nity norm  that can be formulated with convex functions  Such nondifferentiable
priors cannot be ef ciently minimized using simple gradient
descent methods  which form the basis of Wirtinger or amplitude  ow  and many other methods  but can potentially
be solved using standard convex solvers when combined
with the PhaseMax formulation 

  Conclusions
We have proposed   convex relaxation for phase retrieval
problems called PhaseMax that does not require lifting  Using methods from geometric probability  we have provided
tight bounds on the probability of correct signal recovery

lowest number of measurements among the considered methods  but is convex  operates in the original dimension  and comes with sharp
performance guarantees  PhaseLift only terminates in reasonable computation time for      

The proposed problem and its analysis also represents  
radical departure  both in theory and algorithms  from conventional methods for convex or semide nite relaxation  By
providing   convex relaxation for phase retrieval in the native parameter space  our approach opens the door for using
  broad range of convex optimization routines  regularizers 
and priors to solve phase retrieval or related problems in
machine learning  computer vision  or signal processing 
Finally  the new analytical methods used in this paper have
recently been used to prove tight reconstruction bounds
for biconvex problems outside the  eld of phase retrieval
 Aghasi et al    and may be broadly applicable to  
wide range of signal processing problems
