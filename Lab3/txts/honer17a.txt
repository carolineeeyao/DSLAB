Abstract

Sybil detection is   crucial task to protect online
social networks  OSNs  against intruders who
try to manipulate automatic services provided by
OSNs to their customers  In this paper  we  rst
discuss the robustness of graphbased Sybil detectors SybilRank and Integro and re ne theoretically their security guarantees towards more realistic assumptions  After that  we formally introduce adversarial settings for the graphbased
Sybil detection problem and derive   corresponding optimal attacking strategy by exploitation of
trust leaks  Based on our analysis  we propose
transductive Sybil ranking  TSR    robust extension to SybilRank and Integro that directly
minimizes trust leaks  Our empirical evaluation
shows signi cant advantages of TSR over stateof theart competitors on   variety of attacking
scenarios on arti cially generated data and realworld datasets 

  Introduction
The sheer number and variety of online social networks
 OSN  today is staggering  Although the purpose and the
shaping of these networks vary generously  the majority of
them has one aspect in common  the value of most OSNs
is in its user data and the information that one can infer
from the data  This  unfortunately  results in   big incentive for culprits to intrude OSNs and manipulate their data 
One popular method of intruding and attacking an OSN
is referred to as Sybil attack  where the intruder creates  
whole bunch of fake  Sybil  accounts that are all under the
attacker   control  The intruder   in uence over the OSN

is multiplied by the number of accounts created  which
opens possibilities of manipulation typically for gaining
some monetary advantage in the end 
The term  Sybil attack  was coined by Douceur   who
showed that this kind of attack will be always possible unless   trusted agency certi es identities  Unfortunately  this
approach is orthogonal to how OSNs grow  The threshold of registration must be as low as possible to attract as
many new users as possible  On the other hand  Sybil attacks can damage the value of OSNs signi cantly  which
has been proved by the fact that Facebook shares dropped
in   after the company revealed that   signi cant share
of its network is made up by Sybil accounts  The Associated Press   
There exists   number of  classic  featurebased solutions
 Stein et al    Cao et al    Stringhini et al   
Yang et al    However  up until now  it remains an unsolved problem as those methods can be evaded by cleverly
designed attacking schemes  Bilge et al    Boshmaf
et al    Wagner et al    Lowd   Meek    and
manual detection is too expensive  time consuming  and
simply unfeasible in large OSNs  Cao et al   
More recent graphbased Sybil detection methods assume
that honest  nonSybil  nodes form   strongly connected
subgraph and attackers can establish   limited amount of
edges which leads to   sparse cut between the honest subraph and the Sybil nodes  The majority of the graphbased
methods de ne trusted nodes  which the defender is sure to
be honest  and use random walks  Yu et al    Danezis 
  Cao et al    or other typical graphbased algorithms like breadth rstsearch  Tran et al    and belief propagation  Gong et al    to convey trust from the
trusted nodes    node is identi ed as Sybil if suf cient ammount of trust is not delivered to it  Among randomwalk
based approaches  SybilRank is known to be the stateof 
theart  of which the performance is theoretically guaranteed  Cao et al    However  the theory holds only
under unrealistic topological assumptions of the network 
In this paper  we show that the same theoretical guarantee
can be obtained under more realistic situations 
We further dicuss the robustness of the random walk approach against adversarial strategies  To this end  we formally introduce adversarial settings for graphbased Sybil

detection and derive an optimal attacking strategy that is
based on the exploitation of trust leaks  Based on our analysis  we propose   transductive Sybil ranking  TSR  an integrated approach capable of adjusting edge weights based
on sampled trust leaks  We empirically show good performance of TSR against the stateof theart baselines on   variety of attacking scenarios using arti cially generated data
as well as realworld Facebook data 

  Preliminaries
We are given   graph            consisting of nodes  
and pairwise edges   between nodes  We denote GS  
 VS  ES  the Sybil subgraph  GH    VH  EH  the disjunct
honest subgraph  and VT   VH our trusted  veri ed nonSybil nodes  random walk seed nodes  EA is the set of
edges connecting any node in GS and any node in GH 
Sybil Rank is considered the stateof theart graphbased
method to detect Sybil accounts as it outperformed all its
contestants  Cao et al   
It is also based on random walks and operates solely on the topology of the
graph  Sybil Rank starts from the initial distribution      
   
      
    without superscript refers to   vector containing all elements  in which  trust  is assigned to the known
honest nodes VT  

     

 VT  
 

    

if vi   VT  
otherwise 

 

Then  it  propagates  the trust via   short    steps  random
walk 

                     Qk  

 

where              is the transition matrix through the
edges with Qi      Pj              if            
and else   It is known that the stationary distribution    
   is the normalized degree distribution  Behrends   
 

deg      

Vol              

    deg   

Vol        

where deg    is the degree of node         the number of

all incident edges of    and Vol      Pv   deg    is the

sum of the degrees for all nodes in     SybilRank conpensates the effect of degrees  and use the degreenormalized
probability

           

     

 

as the ranking score  where   high ranking indicates   high
probability of being an honest node 
Essentially  SybilRank relies on the assumption that the total number of attacking edges is bounded  Under this assumption  only   small fraction of the trust is propagated

through the sparse cut between the honest network and the
Sybil nodes during the short random walk  while  trust  go
through the  nontrusted  honest nodes through the dense
connections within the the honest subgraph 
Boshmaf et al    developed Integro to cope with  
larger number of attacking edges  To this end  Integro introduces weights on the edges to bias the random walk  where
the weights are determined after its preprocessing step to
detect victims  Here   victim is de ned as   node that established   connection to one of the Sybil nodes  The set of all
victim nodes is de ned by Vv        Vh            EA 
After the detection step  Integro lowers the weights to all
incident edges to the detected victims  which prevents the
trust to propagate through victim nodes  As the victims
form   natural border between the honest and the Sybil
graph  this reduces the overall  ow of trust into the Sybil
graph  Boshmaf et al  found that traditional featurebased
classi cation methods yield good and robust detection of
victims    notable advantage against the featurebased
Sybil detection is that  unlike Sybils  victims generally do
not behave adversarial  as they don   have any incentive to
 hide 

  SybilRank   Security Guarantee Under

More Realistic Assumptions

Cao et al    gave   security guarantee for SybilRank 
Let      EA  be the number of attacking edges and    
     be the number of all nodes in the graph  their theory
relies on the notion of trust leaks 
De nition    Trust leaks  Let rk    Pi VH
    
   be the
trust that remains in the honest graph after    random
walk steps  We call     Pk
  rk    rk  the absolute trust leak  Assume that the attacking edges are created randomly  following   distribution  EA  We call
CH        EA  rk rk 
  the expected relative trust
leak 

rk 

CH    is actually   constant with respect to    under reasonable assumptions on  EA  The following lemma has
been proved 
Lemma    Cao et al    Assume that the graph   is
created randomly  following the con guration model  Molloy   Reed    Then  the expected relative trust leak in
each iteration is given by CH    

vol VH  

This leads to   theoretical guarantee of SybilRank 
Theorem    Cao et al    Assume that the graph   is
created randomly  following the con guration model  The
total number of Sybils that are ranked higher than nonSybils by SybilRank is     log   
Theorem   implies good performance of SybilRank  but

it holds under the assumption that the attacking edges are
created in the same process as the honest graph  which is
not realistic 
Below  we show that the same guarantee is obtained under
the following more realistic assumption 
Assumption   The graph   is constructed by the following steps 

  Honest graph GH construction  GH is connected  nonbipartite  and scale free       the degree distribution
follows the power law distribution 

  Sybil graph GS construction  The topology of GS is

are genarated on all possible edges EA   VS   VH

propability

  and    Pv VH

Under Assumption   evaluating the expected trust leak is
less straightforward  Nevertheless  we can show that it results in the same formal security guarantee stated in Theorem  
To properly compute the expected trust leak 
the following random variables are de ned  Xv counts the
number of attacking edges incident to node    Yv  
deg      is the trust leak in node
      Xv
   
Yv is the total trust leak  Note that here
    is the current amount of trust in node   and not the
stationary distribution of the random walk  This notation
is used to avoid confusion with the probability mass function denoted by     From Assumption   it follows that Xv
is hypergeometrically distributed  Tuckwell    with the
following parameters  the population size       VH VS 
successes          VS  and the draws      EA  Let
     EA  be the number of attacking edges  Moreover  let
nH    VH  and nS    VS  denote the number of honest
nodes and Sybil nodes  respectively 
The probability mass function of Xv is given by    Xv  
   and according to Tuckwell
       
       
  its expected value can be computed by   Xv   
     EA   VS 
  The  nal goal is
   
 VH VS 
to compute the expected value of    The linearity of the
expected value yields        Pv VH   Yv  and for the

       

expected value of Yv we get

 This assumption is not explicitly stated in Cao et al   

but apparent from their derivation

Using this result  the expected value of   becomes       
Pv VH   Yv     
deg      where the right hand
side still contains   sum that needs to be evaluated individually for each node to compute its actual value  In order
to  average out  this sum  we rely on the assumption that
the honest nodes GH is power lawdistributed  Barab asi 
  To do this    new random variable Dv is introduced
which measures the degree of    Then  the assumption results in the probability of   node having   degree of   being
   Dv          
  where   is the Riemann zeta function

               Barab asi   

With this expression  it is possible to  average out  the exact topology of the graph by computing the expected value
with respect to the newly de ned random variable Dv

Total trust in the honest graph

   

 

This yields the following lemma 
Lemma   Under Assumption   the expected relative trust
leak in each iteration of the random walk is given by

 CH    
nH

 

 

       

where       is   constant that depends on the parameter of
the assumed power law distribution for the degree distribution 

Although Lemma   gives   different expected relative trust
leak from Lemma   the fact that the maximum number
of connection for each node is bounded in every OSN and
therefore   nH      vol VH  leads to the same asymptotic behavior as Theorem  
Theorem   Under Assuption   the total number of Sybils
that are ranked higher than nonSybils by SybilRank is
    log   
This result explicitly shows that  asymptotically  SybilRank   security guarantee remains unchanged even under
more realistic Assumption  

  Adversarial Strategies
In this section  we discuss adversarial strategies against
graphbased Sybil detection methods 

Attacker   Action Although attackers in general can
take variety of actions  we restricts their action to adding
attacking edges 

Minimizing Trust Leaks for Robust Sybil Detection

De nition    Attacking strategy  Given an honest graph
GH and   Sybil graph GS  an attacking strategy describes
the set of attacking edges established by the intruder 

The cost of action is measured by the number of attacking
edges 

Attacker   Knowledge Generally  we focus on adversarial attacks against random walk based approaches  That
is  an attacker   strategy for establishing edges from Sybil
nodes to honest nodes in order to cloak an attacker   Sybil
subnetwork  For analysis  we assume different levels of
knowledge that the attacker has on the defender   strategy
and information 

   Strategy only 

   Strategy   topology 

   Strategy   topology   trusted nodes  positively la 

beled nodes 

   Strategy   topology   trusted nodes  positively labeled nodes    untrusted nodes  negatively labeled
nodes 

Here  we divided the level of access to inside information
for the attacker into two groups  In group              
   attackers are able to gather sophisticated information
based on publicly available sources  whereas in group  
         either some backchannel provides nonpublic
information       defender marked Sybil nodes based on
their analysis  or  the attackers are provided with all information visible to the defenders 
Clearly  it is too hard  if not impossible  to have an outof 
thebox solution for the setting described in group   and
we therefore resort our analysis on the settings in group   
In the  rst case     no ef cient adversarial strategies for
graphbased random walk approaches is possible  The attackers must build up suf cient attacking edges to trusted
nodes in order to absorb enough trust 
In     and   
as   special case  on the other hand  the attacker gained
enough information to guide the creation of attacking edges
ef ciently  This paper focuses on this most interesting situation  More speci cally  we assume the following 
the
intruder knows defender   strategy  algorithm details  the
topology of the honest graph  and the set of trusted nodes 
     she knows about GH    VH  EH  and VT   Based on
that knowledge the intruder can establish attacking edges
to honest nodes of her choice with the goal to create an attacking scenario where the applied defense method fails 
Although the exact topology of the Sybil graph is not speci ed any further  for the following results it is assumed that
it is designed in   way that suits the intruder well 

Attacker   Goal Attackers can have various  nal goals 
     spamming honest users to earn money  feeding wrong
information to honest nodes  stealing nonpublic information  damaging countries companies  etc  Depending on
the goal  the objective of the optimal strategy can differ 
We assume that attacker   try to maximize their in uence
and hence  have an inherent need to increase the number of
attacking edges 
Randomwalk based approaches such as SybilRank and Integro rely on the fact that the absolute trust leak   from the
honest graph to the Sybil graph is small       below the
amount needed to reach the stationary distribution within
the Sybil subgraph  which ensures low trust scores for the
Sybil nodes  However  if enough trust is being propagated
to the Sybil graph  trust values will be close to the stationary distribution in the Sybil graph as well as in the honest
graph  Consequently  the degreenormalized ranking values will be similar to the ones in the honest graph  which
makes Sybil nodes indistinguishable from honest nodes and
therefore disables the detector 
De nition    Disabling Attacking Strategy  Let GH and
GS be the honest graph and the Sybil graph  Let         
  be the absolute trust leak as   function of an attacking
strategy  Then  an attacking strategy EA   VH   VS is
said to be disabling if

 
where td is the disabling threshold  which depends on the
topology of the Sybil graph and the detection algorithm 

  EA    td 

Surely  an attacker does not aim for just any disabling strategy but for the one that comes at the lowest cost  As the
cost of an attacking strategy is assumed to be increasing
in the number of attacking edges  an optimal minimal disabling strategy is given by the following de nition 
De nition    Optimal Disabling Strategy  An attacking
strategy AE is said to be optimal if it is the solution to the
following optimization problem 
EA VH VS  EA 

min

 

     

  EA    td 

To solve this  the disabling threshold td and the trust leak
function must be known to the attacker  Ignoring the edge
weights  which are unknown to the attacker  the amount
of trust needed within the Sybil graph to reach the stationary distribution of the random walk is given by td  
vol       To exactly evaluate   EA  the entire random walk needs to be simulated which is infeasible for the attacker without knowing its exact length and
the edge weights    useful estimate is to consider only
the  rst iteration  The computation of this value is feasible and the trust leak per attacking edge is by far the

largest in the  rst iteration because all the trust is concentrated in the relatively small subset of trusted nodes
VT   The trust leak in the  rst iteration    EA  is given by
deg   GH     where     is the attacking degree       the number of attacking edges  of node
   This leads to   greedy strategy where the intruder iteratively adds those attacking edges which produce the largest
increase in     In the following the term adversarial strategy attacker refers to this greedy strategy 

   

  Proposed Method
In this section  we propose our new method and derive
its ef cient solver  Our method is speci cally designed to
cope with   large number of attacking edges by minimizing  trust leaks  that is  minimizing   sampled trust leak
by adjusting the edge weights   missing mechanism for
SybilRank and Integro 

Transductive Sybil Ranking Combining the approach
of Backstrom   Leskovec   and SybilRank  Cao
et al    our proposed method  called transductive
Sybil ranking  TSR  tries to leverage potential prior knowledge  negative labels  to bias   short random walk so that
random walk methods work even with the existence of  
large number of attacking edges 
Assume that all nodes carry attributes and         nodes
are additionally attached with label information       the
defender knows   subset of nodes are honest  and another
subset of nodes are sybil  More formally  the defender is
given labeled nodes      xi  yi        
  
and unlabeled nodes      xi         
     Since only
the honest nodes can be trusted  VT   vi       yi    
holds 
We de ne an edge feature function      between nodes  
and   as             
    corresponding parameterized  nonnegative scoring function fw         is
learned during training and applied as edge weight au

This completes the computation of the gradient and enables
the application of gradientbased methods       BFGS to
 nd    locally  optimal estimate     By using this estimate 
TSR weights the whole graph  with which   short random
walk is performed to obtain the  nal ranking   

Robustness of TSR against Attacks By using the negative label information  our TSR  in principle  monitors
 trust leak  through random walk  and adjusts the edge
weights so that the leak is minimized  As   result  the
weights tend to be lower on the attacking edges  to reduce
the propagation  and higher on the Sybil edges  to boost
the stationary distribution  Thus  we can expect that our
TSR  which is an advanced integrated method  is more robust against attacks than the SybilRank and the twostep
Integro approach 

  Empirical Evaluation on Synthetic Data
To assess the robustness of the proposed method and the
baseline methods  we generate arti cially network topology and edge and node attributes in order to have full control of the underlying ground truth  We separately create
two graphs  the honest and the Sybil graph  Both use the
generation method proposed by Holme   Kim   for
scale free networks  Node features are generated randomly
and correlated through dependency injection  The edge
features function      simply stacks node features of the
two adjacent nodes xu and xv  see Appendix   for more
details  Connections between Sybil and honest graphs are
established according to   random attacking strategy that
iteratively adds attacking edges randomly       equally distributed on the set of all possible attacking edges VH   VS

or   adversarial attacking strategy that solves Problem  
for optimal attacks  This strategy only chooses an honest node to be attacked next and the corresponding Sybil
node is chosen randomly  equally distributed on the set
of all Sybil nodes VS  We test our method  TSR  using
the proposed loss functions and compare against the stateof theart methods SybilRank and Integro  As Integro depends on   preceding victim prediction  we simulated one
that achieves highest possible rankings  ROCAUC close
to  

Random Attacking Strategy We generated   sample
network  VH      and  VS      and select   honest nodes and   Sybil nodes randomly  which will be used
as labeled examples for our TSR  The labeled honest nodes
are also used as the set VT of trusted seeding nodes for
the random walks in all methods  We evaluate the performance in terms of ROCAUC values for the computed
ranking  This procedure was repeated   times for varying number of attacking edges   edges  Figure  
shows ROCAUC curves for all methods under the random
attacking setting  We can obsreve that our TSR  regardless of the choice of loss function  performs superior to the
other methods  Integro   accuracy deteriorates fast but still
has an edge over SybilRank up to the point where the ROCAUC value reaches   After that SybilRank and Integro
essentially perform similar 

Adversarial Attacking Strategy For the adversarial setting  we ran the same benchmarks but this time attacking
edges were added according to the adversarial attacking
strategy  Due to the much more aggressive setting  we
varied the number of attacking edges from   and repeated this procedure   times to report averaged ROCAUC accuracies  The results are depicted in Figure   All
choices of loss functions outperform SybilRank and Integro clearly  The results con rm our considerations that
SybilRank   performance drops fast and steep as soon as
  certain amount of attacking edges is established  Integro
behaves more robust than SybilRank  but  ultimately  must
resign after   few more attacking edges  Again  our TSR
is signi cantly more robust against adversarial attacks and
can withstand higher number of attacking edges until its
performance  nally deteriorates 

  Empirical Evaluation on Realworld Data
We also evaluated our method on   sample of the Facebook
graph Leskovec   Mcauley collected from survey participants using the Facebook app  The dataset includes the
topology          users and         friend 
 SybiRank  Integro  and TSR rely on different information  and
therefore  the fairness of comparison is not trivial  We discuss this
issue in Appendix

As with most of real world social graphs  the data exhibits strong multicluster structure  as seen in Figure  
and Figure   These clusters pose additional challenges to
the application of random walkbased methods as the trust
propagation between two loosely interconnected clusters
is low  Cao et al    Boshmaf et al    Hence  trust
seeds should be distributed among all clusters  Following
SybilRank and Integro  Cao et al    we employ the
Louvian clustering method  Blondel et al     rst 
As common  the Sybil graph needs to be generated  For
this purpose     small  subgraph was copied and declared
as Sybil  The attacking edges were created to link the
honest and the Sybil graph following one of the attacking
strategies  random or adversarial  It was made sure that no
Sybil node attacked one of the direct neighbors of its origin
which is reasonable for most social graphs  Edge features

Figure   Adjacency matrix of the Facebook graph  Nodes
have been grouped together 

for TSR are as follows  the number of shared features  in total  the number of shared friends  and the number of shared
features within speci   categories  The other experimental
setup is the same as the previous section 

Random Attacks The trusted nodes  VT      were randomly distributed among all clusters and   small subset of
Sybils  VD      was chosen as known Sybil nodes  Attacking edges EA were established following the random
attacking strategy ranging from  EA      to  EA     
Experiments were repeated   times  Integro was run with

the recorded average AUROCvalues  Again  SybilRank  
performance drops the fastest and steepest and Integro is insigni cantly better in this adversarial scenario  Both variants of TSR performs better than the baselines  However 
the WMWloss variant performs only slightly better than
SybilRank and Integro  while the hingeloss variant keeps
good performance even for   large number of attacking
edges  As our future work  we will investigate which loss
function should be chosen  depending on data and assumed
attacker   strategy  Overall  whereas SybilRank   and Integro   performance drops to an average AUROCvalue below   at  EA      the hingeloss variant of TSR still
achieves an average value over   at the same amount of
attacking edges 

  Conclusion   Outlook
In this paper  we studied the problem of Sybil detection 
We  rst re ned the security guarantees of random walk approaches towards more realistic assumptions  Then  we
formalized and coined the adversarial setting and introduced optimal strategies for attackers  Further  we proposed   new method  transductive Sybil ranking  TSR  that
leverages prior information  network topology as well as
node and edge features  Unlike Integro  it is fused in   single optimization framework and can be solved ef ciently
by using gradientbased optimizer  In our empirical evaluation  we showed the advantages of our method and investigated the susceptibility of our method and baseline competitors to adversarial attacks  Further research will focus
on the application of our method to realworld  largescale
OSNs

Figure   shows the AUROCvalues  The detection performance of SybilRank is the lowest and drops soon as
attacking edges increase 
Integro with the perfect victim detection outperforms the other methods  but with just
  slight reduction in the victim detection accuracy  AUROC     its performance drops signi cantly  All versions of TSR perform almost on par with perfect version
of Integro in the lower range of attacking edges  
In the higher range   the hinge loss drop fast
to end up with   performance similar to Integro with the
almost perfect victim detection  However  the variant that
uses the WMWloss does not show this performance drop
and stays close to the upperbound of Integro
