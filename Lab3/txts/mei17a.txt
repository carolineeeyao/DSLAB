Abstract

Motivated by electricity consumption reconstitution  we propose   new matrix recovery method
using nonnegative matrix factorization  NMF 
The task tackled here is to reconstitute electricity consumption time series at    ne temporal
scale from measures that are temporal aggregates
of individual consumption  Contrary to existing
NMF algorithms  the proposed method uses temporal aggregates as input data  instead of matrix
entries  Furthermore  the proposed method is extended to take into account individual autocorrelation to provide better estimation  using   recent
convex relaxation of quadratically constrained
quadratic programs  Extensive experiments on
synthetic and realworld electricity consumption
datasets illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed method 

  Introduction
In this paper  we propose   new matrix recovery method
using nonnegative matrix factorization  NMF  Lee   Seung
  where matrix columns represent time series at  
 ne temporal scale  Moreover  only temporal aggregates of
these time series are observed 
The method has its motivation in the context of electricity
load balancing  where time series represent electric power
consumption  To avoid failure in the electricity network 
suppliers are typically required by transmission system operators  TSO  to supply as much electricity as their consumers consume at every moment  This mechanism is
called balancing 
In the context of an open electricity
market  all market participants  such as suppliers  utility
traders  and large consumers  have   balance responsibility  any imbalance caused within the perimeter of   par

ticipant is billed by the TSO  To calculate the imbalance
caused by   market participant  one needs an estimation
of the consumption and production within its perimeter
at   small temporal scale  for example  halfhourly  RTE
  SVK   REE  
However  for many customers  for instance residential 
within   perimeter  electricity consumption is not recorded
at that scale  Although smart meter readings may be
recorded locally up to every minute  utility companies often
have very limited access to such data  due to data transmission and processing costs and or privacy issues  Following
   xed schedule  cumulative consumption of each meter is
recorded by the utility company  for instance every day or
every month  By differentiating consecutive readings  the
utility obtains the consumption of   customer between two
reading dates  Currently  TSOs use proportional rules to
reconstitute consumption from these measurements  based
on national consumption pro les adjusted by temperature 
In this article  we develop an NMFbased matrix recovery
method providing   solution to consumption reconstitution
from such temporal aggregates 
Recent advances in matrix completion have made it clear
that when   large number of individuals and features are
involved  even partial data could be enough to recover
much of lost information  thanks to the lowrank property  Cand es   Recht    although the whole data matrix      RT   is only partially known  if      WH 
where     RT        RK     with   much smaller
than both   and    one could recover    entirely under
some conditions over the sampling process 
In this article  we adress electricity consumption reconstitution as   matrix recovery problem  Consider the electricity consumption of   consumers during   periods  Since
consumption is always positive  the   time series are organized into   nonnegative matrix      RT  
  An entry
of this matrix    
    represents  for example  the electricity
consumption of Consumer   for Period   
Information about consumption is revealed as meter readings which do not correspond to matrix entries but to cumulative sums of each column of    at   meterreading date
     

   we observe that Consumer   has consumed cid

since the  rst period  Several readings are available for
each consumer 
An alternative matrix representation could be to de ne entries directly as the cumulative consumption since the  rst
period  Again  this matrix has missing values and   matrix completion algorithm can be applied  However  this
cumulative matrix has increasing columns  which is quite
different from matrices considered in the standard matrix
completion literature  where matrix completion error is typically bounded by the upper bound on matrix 
We represent meter readings as linear measures on the consumption matrix    Temporal aggregates are derived
from meter readings by differentiating consecutive readings  we will consider these temporal aggregates as  observations  in the rest of the paper  We consider   scalar observations  represented by   data vector            RD
 
where   is   Ddimensional linear operator  To recover   
from    we look for   lowrank NMF of    WH  cid    
where     RT  
  The columns of   are
  nonnegative factors  which can be interpreted as typical
pro les of the   time series  and the columns of   as the
weights of each individual  The problem is formalized as
the minimization of   quadratic loss function under nonnegativity and data constraints

The simplex projection algorithm introduced by Chen

operator  PA  as the orthogonal projection into the simplex
         RT  
             is the intersection
of the af ne subspace      RT             and the

Contrary to previously studied algorithms  Roughan et al

steps in our algorithm  Instead of multiplying the rank and
the complexity introduced by the number of measurements 
we have an algorithm whose complexity is the sum of the
two  In cases where the number of measurements is large 
this difference can be crucial

Convergence to   stationary point has been proved for past
NMF solvers with the full observation or the matrix completion setting  Guan et al    Kim et al    Our
algorithms have similar convergence property  Although
the subproblems on   and   do not necessarily have
unique optimum  the projection of   attains   unique minimizer  By Grippo   Sciandrone   Proposition   the
convergence to   stationary point is guaranteed 
Algorithm   can be generalized to other types of measurement operators    as long as   projection into the simplex

constraint can be ef ciently computed 

  From autocorrelation constraint to penalization

In addition to the measurements in    we have some prior
knowledge on the temporal autocorrelation of the individuals  To take into account information about autocorrelation 
we add   penalization term to the original matrix recovery
problem  replacing   by

rest of this section  we  rst show by Theorem   that with
an appropriately chosen value of   adding the penalization
term   cid

autocorrelation of vn to be at least equal to       prior

penalized problem

For each individual in   dataset  we generate observations
by selecting   number of observation periods  The temporal aggregates are the sum of the time series between
two consecutive observation periods  The observation periods are chosen in two possible ways  periodically  at regular intervals with the  rst observation period sampled at
random  or uniformly at random  The regular intervals
for periodic observations are                  
This is motivated by the real application where meter readings are recorded regularly  With random observations 
we use sampling rates that are equivalent to the regular
intervals  That is  the number of observations   veri es

outperform interpolation with both observation schemes 
This makes penalized methods particularly useful for the
application of electricity consumption reconstituion  where
it may be costly to install   random observation scheme 
or to change the current periodic observation scheme to  
random one

Figure   Mean RRMSE of the recovered matrices over three separate runs over the four datasets  On the samples with random observation periods  proposed methods  HALS and NeNMF  blue and purple lines  both penalized and unpenalized  outperforms the
interpolation benchmark  solid red line  On the samples with regular observation periods  unpenalized HALS and NeNMF  solid blue
and purple lines  are similar to the interpolation benchmark  whiled penalized HALS and NeNMF  dashed blue and purple lines  are an
important improvement  The softImpute method  solid green line  only has comparable performance in two of the datasets  in the easiest
task   sampling rate at random periods  In most cases  RRMSE of softImpute is larger than  

It is also interesting to note that the rank chosen by the
cross validation procedure is higher in higher sampling rate
scenarios  Figure   This shows that the cross validation
procedure is able to relax the rank constraint when more
information is available in the data 
The traditional matrix completion method seems to fail in
this application  softImpute  green solid lines  only has
comparable results to interpolation or proposed methods in
two of the four datasets  with   sampling rate in the random sampling scheme  which is the easiest case  In most
cases  softImpute has an RRMSE much larger than  
and thus is not shown in the graphic  This indicates that
the cumulative matrix considered in this application does
not verify assumptions which guarantee matrix completion
success 

  Perspectives
Motivated by   new industrial application  we extended
NMF to use temporal aggregates as input data  by adding
  projection step into NMF algorithms  With appropriate
projection algorithms  this approach could be further generalized to other types of data  such as disaggregating spatially aggregated data  or general linear measures  When
such information is available  we introduce   penalization
on individual autocorrelation  which improves the recovery
performance of the base algorithm  This component can be
generalized to larger lags  with   matrix   with    further off the diagonal  or multiple lags  by adding several
lag matrices together  It is also possible to generalize this
approach to other types of expert knowledge through additional constraints on

Figure   The rank chosen by the cross validation procedure generally increases with the sampling rate  for the four datasets  This shows
that procedure is able to relax the rank constraint when more information is available in the data
