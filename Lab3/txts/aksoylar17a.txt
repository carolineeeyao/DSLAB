Abstract

We propose   novel  computationally ef cient
mirrordescent based optimization framework for
subgraph detection in graphstructured data  Our
aim is to discover anomalous patterns present in
  connected subgraph of   given graph  This
problem arises in many applications such as detection of network intrusions  community detection  detection of anomalous events in surveillance videos or disease outbreaks  Since optimization over connected subgraphs is   combinatorial and computationally dif cult problem  we
propose   convex relaxation that offers   principled approach to incorporating connectivity and
conductance constraints on candidate subgraphs 
We develop   novel ef cient algorithm to solve
the relaxed problem  establish convergence guarantees and demonstrate its feasibility and performance with experiments on real and very large
simulated networks 

  Introduction
We consider the problem of connected subgraph detection  motivated by statistical anomaly detection on networks where the aim is to determine whether there exists
  set of connected nodes that exhibit anomalous signal values  One example of network anomaly detection is disease outbreak detection  Patil et al    where the nodes
are associated with counties that are linked by geographical
neighborhood and signal values on nodes depict the number of patients related to   disease  In the existence of  
disease outbreak that spreads geographically  higher signal
values would be present on certain counties that are neighbors of each other  therefore constituting   subgraph structure  Similar problems in different research areas also exist 
such as detection of intrusions in communication or sensor
networks  community detection or video surveillance

The detection or estimation of arbitrary connected subgraphs over graphstructured signals is an example of  
structured signal recovery problem and generalizes many
useful
types of structures such as intervals or paths
 AddarioBerry et al    AriasCastro et al   
While the existence of structure in terms of connectivity
leads to better statistical complexity in detecting or recovering the anomalous sets compared to arbitrary subsets  ef 
cient characterization of sets obeying the connectivity constraint is important for obtaining practical algorithms for
detection and estimation  In this paper we aim to characterize the space of arbitrary connected subsets of nodes in
  graph via spectral relaxation and propose ef cient optimization algorithms that exploit this characterization 
Related work and contributions  Subgraph detection is
  dif cult problem since connected subgraphs represent  
combinatorial structure and systematic approaches to characterizing the space of connected subgraphs of   given
graph are relatively recent  Traditional approaches to this
problem usually consider parametric methods  which originate from the scan statistics literature  Glaz et al   
and consider scanning for speci   shapes such as rectangles  circles or neighborhood balls on graphs  Patil et al 
  Kulldorff et al    Priebe et al    More recently nonparametric approaches have been considered for
subgraphs with arbitrary shapes on general graphs such as
the simulated annealing approach of  Duczmal   Assuncao    however it is   heuristic method without statistical or computational guarantees  There is also   line
of work focused on statistical analysis with nonparametric shapes  AddarioBerry et al    AriasCastro et al 
    but are computationally intractable 
More recently   Qian et al    Qian   Saligrama   
proposed linear matrix inequalities as   way to characterize the connectivity of subsets of nodes exactly  This approach is the similar to ours where we also consider an
SDP relaxation with LMI constraints  however we take  
different approach to formulating the problem and its relaxation  with the goal to obtain   convex optimization program that is amenable to ef cient iterative methods 
In
contrast  the aforementioned method is only applicable to
small problem sizes  Another notable work in this area is
the spectral scan statistic approach proposed by  Sharpnack
et al    which presents   computationally tractable al

gorithm with consistency guarantees  However this method
aims to obtain graph partitions with small conductance and
balanced sizes  in contrast to our formulation that guarantees connected subgraphs 
In recent work   Wu et al 
  consider nonparametric statistics for signals in addition to nonparametric shapes  obtaining   computationally
tractable algorithm by heuristically approximating the underlying graph with trees 
The contribution of this paper is twofold  First  we develop
  convex relaxation of the subgraph detection problem that
results in an semide nite optimization formulation  with
provable guarantees on the connectivity of the resulting solutions related to the internal conductance of the subgraph 
Second  we propose an ef cient iterative framework for optimizing the SDP that scales well with large problem sizes 
and show computational guarantees  One of the major differences of our formulation to those of  Qian et al   
Qian   Saligrama    is that prior work enforce   number of constraints that scale with the problem size  whereas
ours only considers   constant number of constraints  Also 
while aforementioned work utilized generalized convex optimization solvers  our formulation allows us to propose
specialized and ef cient iterative algorithms 

  Connected Subgraph Detection
In this section we de ne the notation and introduce the two
statistical models that we consider for the connected subgraph detection problem  Let            denote an undirected unweighted connected graph with   nodes that is
provided as input to the problem  For         we write di
for the degree of vertex   in   and let   be an upper bound
on all di  For   subset         the notation Vol    indicates the volume measure of         Vol      Pi   di 
We also denote by GS       ES  the subgraph induced by
the subset    For an input root vertex         we write
                     GS is connected in    Indicator
vectors with notation    are de ned as       vectors with
ith index   if       and zero otherwise 
We consider observations xv   Rp associated with each
node       in the graph    We are concerned with optimization problems of the form

for   cost function    which depends on xS    xv     
We remark that this is   dif cult problem due to the combinatorial nature of the constraint  in fact variants of the
prizecollecting Steiner tree problem which is known to be
NPhard  Johnson et al    can be reduced to the above
formulation  Below we provide two examples of the setup
that we consider  namely elevated mean detection and correlation detection 

Elevated mean detection  Here  the aim is to detect the
existence of   subgraph        comprising of nodes with
an elevated mean compared to the other nodes    simple
example is the Gaussian elevated mean model  where xv  
          zv for       and zv        Another
example we consider is the Poisson variant  where xv  
Poisson          We consider the optimization
  with the scan statistic

    Xi  

which can be shown to correspond to the generalized likelihood ratio test  GLRT  for the Gaussian detection problem 
while also encouraging graphsparse solutions 
Correlation detection  Another example is the problem
of detecting and estimating   subgraph with correlated
signal values  The canonical statistical model that has
been investigated for this problem is where the signals
are jointly Gaussian random variables            Xn  where
cov Xi  Xj      if          if          and zero otherwise
 AriasCastro et al    Note that while related work
consider arbitrary ksets or special shapes such as intervals
for    we allow arbitrary connected subgraphs  One simple test for detecting or estimating   correlated subgraph
induced by set   is   with the scan statistic

where   is the estimated covariance matrix which can either be de ned by   single observation xx  when       or
multiple observations for      
Characterizing subgraph connectivity  Rather than focusing on exactly characterizing the connectedness of an
induced subgraph GS  we aim to enforce it by lower bounding the conductance of cuts within GS  For   weighted
graph               the conductance of   cut   is 

       

           

Vol   

 

where             is the total weight of edges connecting nodes in   to nodes in        The graph conductance is the lowest conductance among cuts containing at most half of the volume of the graph           
minS    Vol   Vol           Conductance is   natural
graphpartitioning objective because of its intimate connection with the behavior of random walks  It is also widely
used in practice in the design of clustering and segmentation algorithms  We can use conductance to ensure subgraph connectivity by imposing the following constraints 
 Note that for technical reasons  the conductance  GS on the
induced graph GS still employs the de nition of volume given by
the larger graph

For   suf ciently small          Vol     this requirement is equivalent to the connectivity condition on GS  It
is useful to notice at this stage that the condition in constraint   is stronger than   lower bound on the conductance of the induced subgraph GS 
Indeed  for an unweighted graph the constraint   implies

exactly for      with       This linear functional formulation is very general and can be adapted to solve subgraph problems with other general cost functions 
Next  we propose   novel SDP formulation of the connected subgraph constraint       Mii          as  
single linear matrix inequality based on   spectral relaxation of the integral conductance constraint of

requiring the induced conductance of GS to be   as the
bound also holds for subsets       comprising more than
half the volume of GS  In the appendix  we provide   brief
comparison with other measures of connectivity 

  Relaxation
We next consider   convex relaxation of the objectives of
  and   as   linear functional of positive semide nite
matrix variable    We remark that in the case that    
        the Poisson model  maximizing the scan statistic
     is equivalent to maximizing its square

We relax this IP to   semide nite program  SDP  by turning each element ui to   vector vi   Rn such that scalar

also enforce nonnegativity by requiring that hvi  vji

 due to the homogeneity of the ratio in the objective  we

  Spectral Graph Theory
We start by introducing some basic notation and concepts
from spectral graph theory  For   weighted graph    
 VH  EH     we denote its adjacency by AH and its degree
matrix DH  The Laplacian of   is then de ned as LH  
DH   AH  The      Laplacian matrix for the graph on  
consisting only of edge        is Lij   eii   ejj   eij   eji 
where eij is an allzero matrix except for   one at index
       Notice that LH         EH
hijLij  We omit the
subscripts for all graph matrices and sets when referring to
the instance graph    For   subset         we denote by
KS the complete graph on         the graph having an edge
of weigth didj between   and   for any           The spectral gap    of an induced subgraph GS of the input graph

Cheeger   inequality  An important result in spectral
graph theory is Cheeger   inequality  Chung    that relates the conductance of   graph with the spectrum of its
Laplacian  An equivalent statement for the subgraph conductance that follows from Cheeger   inequality and relates
the spectral gap of GS to the conductance of GS can be
written as follows 
Theorem    Cheeger   Inequality  For           
 GS       
The righthand side of this inequality is proved by rounding
the generalized eigenvector of LGS associated with    to  
lowconductance cut by using the following lemma 
Lemma   Let       and yr     Assume that
yT LGS     Pi   diy

  Relaxing the Conductance Requirement
Our proposed relaxation of the integral conductance constraint   with parameter   is the following 

notation for its constraints  Let           be our relaxed connectedness constraint               LG      
 
  LStar       Then our relaxation is given by

LG      

 
 

LStar      

 

To see how this relaxes the integral constraint  take MS  
     to be an integral solution corresponding to   sub 
 
   
set         We have 
LGS
LG MS    

and LStar   MS    

LStar   

 

 

 
   

 
   

 

 

 

  LStar   

our proposed constraint becomes LGS

Then 
 
 
  We now show that this constitutes   relaxation
  LStar   
of constraint   This can be seen as   variant of Cheeger  
inequality for our relaxed notion of conductance in   The
proof of the following theorem appears in the appendix 
Theorem   For         if  for all              and
 GS          then LGS    
Moreover  for   candidate integral solution MS  in the same
way as the integral constraint lower bounds the conductance of the induced subgraph GS  our relaxation can be
shown to lower bound the spectral gap of GS  This result
is   simple consequence of Schur   complementation 
Lemma   For       with       
 Vol      dr  er   Pj       djej  Then  LStar   
Vol     LKS   yy   

Applying this lemma to   we observe that our constraint 
applied to an integral solution MS  implies   lower bound
of  
  on the induced spectral gap    through the inequality

Finally  we prove that if any feasible candidate   that satis es   is rounded to   subset   in   certain way  then the
connectivity of subgraph GS is ensured  This result shows
that the inequality constraint   is suf cent to ensure connectivity in our framework 
Theorem   For any     and       that satis es  
the subgraph      for induced subset               Mii  
  is connected 
Proof of Theorem   is in the appendix  It follows from an
alternative formulation of constraint   based on effective
resistance in electrical networks 

  Primal and Dual Formulations
In this subsection  we study the dual form of our relaxation  which will be important in designing an ef cient iterative algorithm  We start by introducing some shorthand

max

      

       

      

 

We now write the SDP dual of our relaxation  We consider   scalar   as the Lagrange multiplier corresponding
to constraint           and matrices        Rn   corresponding to           and       respectively  Let
               Lij      eij    Pi   di Lri      eii
be the transpose of the constraint                    
            The dual can then be written as 

min

 

                  
                 

An intuitive interpretation for this dual follows from considering       as   matrix of gains to be added to the objective   as to force the primal solution   towards feasibility  In particular        establishes   gain of Lij     for
including edge        in the primal solution and   cost of
Lri     for including vertex   in the primal solution  Naturally  vertices are more expensive the further they are from
the root   in the dual solution and edges are more bene cial
if they bridge longer distances in the dual 
Distinctive Properties of Our Relaxation We wish to
highlight two important  and rare  structural properties of
our relaxation  The  rst property relates to the form of
the dual  We have       by de nition for the elevated mean problem with nonnegative signal values and
with high probability for correlation detection  Then the
term           in the dual constraint is the sum of  
nonnegative matrix plus   diagonal matrix  By the PerronFrobenius Theorem  the top eigenvector of this matrix has
nonnegative components  allowing us to assume that      
wlog  We will use the same reasoning in the next section
to show that we do not need to explicitly enforce the   
elementwise nonnegativity constraints corresponding to
      as our dual formulation will automatically yield
such solutions  This is   great advantage of our relaxation
as enforcing the       constraints is known to be   computational roadblock to the ef cient solution of SDP relaxations of    integral problems 
The second property has   similar  avor  but it concerns
the primal optimal solution  It is captured by the following
theorem  which is proved in the appendix 
Theorem   When       the relaxation   always has
an optimal solution of rank  Moreover  any higher rank
solution   can be turned into   rank  solution mm  such
that Mii     
   

Connected Subgraph Detection with Mirror Descent on SDPs

The fact that   rank  solution is   remarkable property for
  SDP relaxation  making the fractional solution easier to
visualize and hopefully easier to round to integral 
Future work  In this work  we did not perform   theoretically study of the approximation guarantees achievable in
rounding our relaxation to an integral solution in the worstcase  The rank  property of the optimal solution should
be useful in this pursuit  At the same time  we believe that
additional constraints may be required to obtain meaningful approximation guarantees in the worstcase  This is an
interesting direction for future work 
Statistical Bounds  We omit developing statistical analysis of the proposed approach for subgraph detectability in
this paper for lack of space  see  Aksoylar    for analysis for simple graphs  We can derive statistical guarantees for grid graphs similar to  Qian   Saligrama   
based on analyzing primal and dual values  In particular
the primal provides   bound on the value of the positive
hypothesis  anomaly  while   feasible solution to the dual
provides an upperbound of the value for null hypothesis 
Detectability bounds for elevated mean follows by comparing the primal value with the dual

  Mirror Descent on SDPs
We  rst consider   modi cation of our original SDP by
adding the slack variable       For some  xed margin
value       we write

discuss choices of   at the end of this section

  to be the Dspectrahedron         
          For this dual optimization over   we utilize the mirror descent method  which is the optimal optimization algorithm for nonsmooth functions in the blackbox model  We refer the reader to Section   of  BenTal
  Nemirovski    for more details on mirror descent

and its application in the spectahedron setup  For the purposes of this section  we simply state the following theorem  which is   simple consequence of Theorem   in
 BenTal   Nemirovski   
Theorem   Let   be   convex function over the specn such that kD rY               for

    For   parameter      
     the mirror descent
all       
update takes the following form at iteration   

       

exp      hPt 
    exp      hPt 

   rY             
   rY             

With this update  the algorithm achieves the following performance guarantee  where    is the minimum of   

                     log  

 

 

To apply mirror descent as described in the previous theorem  we need access to the gradient of   at       By Danskin   Theorem  Bertsekas et al    this is given by 

rY           

 
           

        arg maxM        

 
                
Hence  computation of the gradient requires  nding      
which plays the role of the primal update at time    However  this is just the rank  matrix given by the projection
over the top eigenvector of      
            where      
is once again ensured by PerronFrobenius  The following
lemma provides us with   bound on the Lipschitz parameter   of our objective    Its straightforward proof appears

  Experiments
We present experiments on two datasets    real world geographical network of disease outbreaks and elevated mean
detection on very large random geometric graphs  In the
former we compare the statistical detection performance of
our mirror descent  MD  algorithm with subgraph detection methods from related work  For the latter we demonstrate the scalability of our method on large graphs 

  Disease Outbreak Detection
We consider   geographical map and its corresponding network that are illustrated in Figures    and    respectively 

    appears in Fig     

with   nodes representing counties in the northeastern
United States and average degree   The ground truth
cluster of   nodes for the anomalous case and the chosen anchor node are also illustrated  Following  Patil et al 
  and  Qian et al    Qian   Saligrama    we
consider an elevated mean Poisson formulation for modeling the diseased population  where the number of disease
cases yi for   county   is given by yi   Poisson Ni 
where Ni is the population of the county  whereas for
anomalous counties we have yi   Poisson Ni  We
consider           for the base disease rate and different  
ratios       corresponding to different
 
SNR values  As our test statistic we consider the disease
rate per person xi   yi
  One sample realization for the
Ni
anomaly case with high SNR  
 
To compare the performance with MD as proposed in Algorithm   we consider several other methods in the related literature  including the LMItest  LMIT  method
of  Qian   Saligrama    simulated annealing  SA 
of  Duczmal   Assuncao    and the nearestball test
 NB  which is   parametric method that scans over nearestneighbor balls of different sizes for all nodes  For the MD
method we consider the optimization value xx      as the
scan statistic  with       iterations        and different
  values to quantify the size and conductance of the anomalous graph  For LMIT we use the same anchor node as MD 
anomaly size         corresponding to the ground truth
and consider scan statistic    diag     We search over  
range of values for parameter   For SA and NB we consider the test statistic Pi   xip   
  We initialize SA with the
result from NB and run for   restarts  To quantify detection performance  we threshold the scan statistics given by
the algorithms with various threshold values and compute
missed detection and false positive rates over   number of

Figure   Performance of MD algorithm for different   values 
Comparison to related methods  We also compare AUC
performance of MD to aforementioned methods and tabulate the results in Table   For MD we use     value of
  and for LMIT we use     value of   which we observed to perform best empirically  We see that MD performs relatively similar to LMIT  with better performance
at some SNR levels  This is expected since the LMI connectivity constraints in both methods are very similar  even
though the relaxation to the space of matrices   differ 
On the other hand SA and NB perform worse  with SA
not signi cantly improving upon the results of NB  It is
also notable that the performance of these three methods
seem low when compared to their performance in  Qian  
Saligrama    which can be partially explained by the
different scan statistics used  the Poisson likelihood test in
contrast to the simpler linear form we speci ed above to
be better in line with the scan statistic of MD  It is also
possible that the performance of SA can be improved with
  larger number of restarts  We also provide the average
runtime for the recovery methods for   single set of measurements in Table   where the experiments were run on
MATLAB on   computer with an Intel      processor 

  Random Geometric Graphs
We also conducted experiments on simulated geometric
graphs to demonstrate the scalability of our method  For
this  we generated   points uniformly on the hypercube

     and created approximate kNN graphs using the
ANN library  Arya et al    We generated anomalous
clusters by determining points that fall in hyperellipsoids
centered at the origin of the space  We consider different
hyperellipsoid axes lengths that correspond to different internal subgraph conductance 
Memory and runtime scalability  For very large graphs
with   nodes  storing on memory and operating on nonsparse       matrices present major problems for computational feasibility  While for primal variable   we work
directly with vectors   in Alg    we also consider   lowerrank approximation scheme for representing dual variable
  and an approximate computation for the matrix exponential  We de ne an       matrix Yk such that we have the
    exp               where       is an
update

appropriately  We then utilize the Leja method  Caliari
et al    to directly compute the action of the matrix
exponential on vectors  We again consider elevated mean
detection with yi   Poisson  for nonanomalous nodes
and yi   Poisson  otherwise  We speci cally consider
 NN graphs with parameters       and       We
consider two types of anomalous clusters   thick  cluster
as   sphere with radius   and  thin  cluster as an ellipsoid
with radii           where   is chosen such that on average
the clusters would contain       nodes 
Performance for different conductance anomalies and

ply these methods to the large graphs  For MD  we chose
 
      for the thick cluster and       for the thin
one  We chose   random node in the cluster as the anchor 
      vectors for approximating   and ran the algorithm
for       iterations  From the results we observe that
MD and NB perform similarly on thick clusters  This is expected since   spherical cluster is the optimal scenario for
NB  whereas MD still considers different shaped and sized
clusters for the given gamma  However for the thin cluster
we observe that MD improves upon NB signi cantly as expected  especially for higher SNR values  We also note that
each iteration of MD takes about    and empirically scales
linearly with    as we demonstrate in the next set of experiments  where we applied the method for graphs with up
to   nodes

Performance for graph sizes and iterations  We also investigate the effect of graph size   in conjunction with the

the detection AUC  We again consider random geometric

we observe that detection accuracy deteriorates for larger
graph sizes as expected  Moreover  the rate of increase
in the accuracy with the increasing number of iterations
  does not seem to change too much for different sizes
   which lends empirical support to Theorem   regarding
the sublinear relationship between accuracy and    We also
plot the average runtime per iteration vs  graph size with
standard deviation error bars in Fig    which illustrates
