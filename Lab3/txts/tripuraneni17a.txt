exploits
Hamiltonian dynamics to construct ef cient proposals for Markov chain Monte Carlo  MCMC 
In this paper  we present   generalization of
HMC which exploits noncanonical Hamiltonian
dynamics  We refer to this algorithm as magnetic
HMC  since in   dimensions   subset of the dynamics map onto the mechanics of   charged particle coupled to   magnetic  eld  We establish
  theoretical basis for the use of noncanonical
Hamiltonian dynamics in MCMC  and construct
  symplectic  leapfroglike integrator allowing
for the implementation of magnetic HMC  Finally  we exhibit several examples where these
noncanonical dynamics can lead to improved
mixing of magnetic HMC relative to ordinary

  Introduction
Probabilistic inference in complex models generally requires the evaluation of intractable  highdimensional integrals  One powerful and generic approach to inference is to
use Markov chain Monte Carlo  MCMC  methods to generate asymptotically exact  but correlated  samples from  
posterior distribution for inference and learning  Hamiltonian Monte Carlo  HMC   Duane et al    Neal   
is   stateof theart MCMC method which uses gradient information from an absolutely continuous target density to
encourage ef cient sampling and exploration  Crucially 
HMC utilizes proposals inspired by Hamiltonian dynamics
 corresponding to the classical mechanics of   point particle  which can traverse long distances in parameter space 
HMC  and variants like NUTS  which eliminates the need
to handtune the algorithm   hyperparameters  have been
successfully applied to   large class of probabilistic inference problems where they are often the gold standard for

In this paper  we  rst review important properties of Hamiltonian dynamics  namely energypreservation  symplecticity  and timereversibility  and derive   more general class
of dynamics with these properties which we refer to as noncanonical Hamiltonian dynamics  We then discuss the relationship of noncanonical Hamiltonian dynamics to wellknown variants of HMC and propose   novel extension of
HMC  We refer to this method as magnetic HMC  see Algorithm   since it corresponds to   particular subset of the
noncanonical dynamics that in   dimensions map onto to
the mechanics of   charged particle coupled to   magnetic
 eld   see Figure   for an example of these dynamics  Furthermore  we construct an explicit  symplectic  leapfroglike integrator for magnetic HMC which allows for an ef 
cient numerical integration scheme comparable to that of
ordinary HMC  Finally  we evaluate the performance of
magnetic HMC on several sampling problems where we
show how its noncanonical dynamics can lead to improved
mixing  The proofs of all results in this paper are presented
in the corresponding sections of the Appendix 

  Markov chain Monte Carlo
Given an unnormalized target density   de ned on Rd 
an MCMC algorithm constructs an ergodic Markov chain
       such that the distribution of    converges to  
      in total variation   Robert   Casella    Often  the
transition kernel of such   Markov chain is speci ed by the
MetropolisHastings  MH  algorithm which     given the

current state        proposes   new state cid  by sampling
from   proposal distribution    and  ii  sets      cid 

with probability min
and         otherwise  The role of the acceptance step is to enforce reversibility  or detailed balance  of the Markov chain with
respect to     which implies   is   stationary distribution of
the transition kernel 
Heuristically    good MH algorithm should have low intersample correlation while maintaining   high acceptance ratio  Hamiltonian Monte Carlo provides an elegant mechanism to do this by simulating   particle moving along the
contour lines of   dynamical system  constructed from the
target density  to use as   MCMC proposal 

  Hamiltonian Monte Carlo

In Hamiltonian Monte Carlo  the target distribution is augmented with  momentum  variables   which are independent of the   variables but of equal dimension  For the
remainder of the paper  we take the distribution over the
momentum variables to be Gaussian  as is common in the
literature  indeed  there is evidence that in many cases  the
choice of   Gaussian distribution may be optimal  Betancourt    The joint target distribution is therefore 

              cid            

 

Crucially  this augmentation allows Hamiltonian dynamics
to be used as   proposal for an MCMC algorithm over the
space      where we interpret    resp     as position
 resp  momentum  coordinates of   physical particle with
total energy       given by the sum of its potential energy     and kinetic energy   cid    We brie   review
the Markov chain construction below  see  Neal    or
 Duane et al    for   more detailed description  Given
the Markov chain state     pn  at time    the new state
for time       is obtained by  rst resampling momentum
pn          and then proposing   new state according to

While the momentum resampling ensures the Markov
chain explores the joint      space  the proposals inspired
by Hamiltonian dynamics can traverse long distances in
parameter space   reducing the randomwalk behavior of
MH that often results in highly correlated samples  Neal 
 

  Symplectic Numerical Integration

Unfortunately  it is rarely possible to integrate the  ow
de ned in   analytically  instead an ef cient numerical
integration scheme must be used to generate   proposal
for the MHtype accept reject test  Typically  the leapfrog
 St ormerVerlet  integrator is used since it is an explicit
method that is both symplectic and timereversible  Neal 
  One elegant way to motivate this integrator is by
decomposing the Hamiltonian into   symmetric splitting

to Euler translations  can be written 

respect to            cid             
   which also implies volumepreservation of the  ow

since the Hamilton equations   for the subHamiltonians
   and      are linear  and hence analytically integrable  One leapfrog step is then de ned as

As each of the  ows           exactly integrates
  subHamiltonian  they inherit the symplecticity  volumepreservation  and timereversibility of the exact dynamics 
Moreover  since the composition of symplectic  ows is also
symplectic and the splitting scheme is symmetric  implying the composition of timereversible  ows is also timereversible  the Jacobian term in the acceptance probability
  is exactly   as in the case of perfect simulation 
The leapfrog scheme will not exactly preserve the
Hamiltonian   
so the remaining acceptance ratio

exp      pn      cid   cid pn  must be calculated 

However  the leapfrog integrator has error    in one
leapfrog step  Hairer et al    This error scaling will
lead to good energy conservation properties  and thus high
acceptance rates in the MH step  even when simulating
over long trajectories 

  NonCanonical Hamiltonian Monte Carlo
In Section   we noted the role timereversibility  volumepreservation  and energy conservation of canonical Hamiltonian dynamics play in making them useful candidates for
MCMC  In this section  we develop the properties of   general class of  ows we refer to as noncanonical Hamiltonian systems that parallel these properties  we use to construct our method magnetic HMC  see Algorithm

Within the formal construction of classical mechanics  it
is known that any Hamiltonian  ow de ned on the cotangent bundle      of   con guration manifold  which is
equipped with an arbitrary symplectic  form  will preserve its symplectic structure and admit the corresponding Hamiltonian as    rst integral invariant  Arnold   
The statement of Lemma   is simply   restatement of
this fact grounded in   coordinate system  Similar arbitrary  antisymmetric terms have also appeared in the study
of MCMC algorithms based on diffusion processes  such
samplers often do not enforce detailed balance with respect to the target density and are often implemented as discretizations of stochastic differential equations  ReyBellet
  Spiliopoulos    Ma et al    in contrast to the
approach taken here 
Our second observation is that the dynamics in   are not
timereversible in the traditional sense  Instead  if we consider the parametrization of   as

where      are antisymmetric and   is taken to be general
such that   is invertible  then the noncanonical dynamics
have    pseudo  timereversibility symmetry

Lemma   suggests   generalization of HMC that can utilize an arbitrary invertible antisymmetric   matrix in its
dynamics  however Lemma   indicates the noncanonical
dynamics lack   traditional timereversibility symmetry
which poses   potential dif culty to satisfying detailed
balance 
In particular  we cannot compose    with an
exact approximate simulation of

Magnetic Hamiltonian Monte Carlo

Our solution to obtaining   timereversible proposal is simply to  ip the elements of the   and   matrices just as
ordinary HMC  ips the auxiliary variable      at the end of
Hamiltonian  ow in the proposal and ii  once again after
the MH acceptance step to return   to its original direction 
In this vein  we view the parameters   and   as auxiliary
variables in the state space  and simultaneously  ip      
and   after having simulated the dynamics  rendering the
proposal timereversible according to Lemma     see Section   in the Appendix for full details of this construction 
This ensures that detailed balance is satis ed for this entire
proposal  To avoid  random walk  behaviour in the resulting Markov chain  we can apply   sign  ip to   and   
in addition to    to return them to their original directions
after the MH acceptance step 
The validity of this construction relies on equipping   and
  with symmetric auxiliary distributions  For the remainder of this paper  we further restrict to binary symmetric
auxiliary distributions supported on   given antisymmetric
matrix    and its sign  ip       see Appendix   for
full details  This restriction is not necessary  but gives rise
to   simple and interpretable class of algorithms  which is
in spirit closest to using  xed parameters   and    whilst
ensuring the proposal satis es detailed balance  This construction is also reminiscent of lifting constructions prevalent in the discrete Markov chain literature  Chen et al 
  heuristically  the signed variables   and   favour
proposals in opposing directions 

  Symplectic Numerical Integration for

NonCanonical Dynamics

As with standard HMC  exactly simulating the  ow   
  
is rarely tractable  and   numerical integrator is required
to approximate the  ow 
It is not absolutely necessary
to use an explicit  symplectic integration scheme 
indeed implicit integrators are used in Riemannian HMC to
maintain symplecticity of the proposal which comes at  
greater complexity and computational cost  Girolami et al 
  However explicit  symplectic integrators are simple 
have good energyconservation properties  and are volumepreserving timereversible  Hairer et al    so for the
present discussion we restrict our attention to investigating
leapfroglike schemes 
We begin  as in Section   by considering the symmetric splitting   yielding the subHamiltonians     
             cid    The corresponding noncanonical dynamics for the subHamiltonians    and
     are

    and
We denote the corresponding  ows by

it is solved by an Euler translation as before  Crucially  the

See the Appendix for   detailed derivation which also handles the general case where   is not invertible  Thus when
      are analytically
      the  ows   
tractable and will inherit the generalized symplecticity and
 pseudo  timereversibility of the exact dynamics in  
Therefore if we use the symmetric splitting   to construct
  leapfroglike step 

    and

we can construct   total proposal that consists of several
leapfrog steps  followed by    ip of the momentum and   
         which will be   volumepreserving  selfinverse

Henceforth we will always take       when we use
 frog  
      to generate leapfrog proposals  which interestingly corresponds to   magnetic dynamics as discussed in
Lemma     full description of the magnetic HMC algorithm using this numerical integrator is described in Section
 

  Special Cases
Here  we describe several tractable subcases of the general
formulation of noncanonical Hamiltonian dynamics since
these they have interesting physical interpretations 

  Mass Preconditioned Dynamics

One simple variant of HMC is preconditioned HMC where
            Neal    and can be implemented
nearly identically to ordinary HMC  We note that preconditioning can be recovered within our framework using  
simple form for the noncanonical   matrix 
Lemma      Preconditioned HMC with momentum variable            in the      coordinates is exactly
equivalent to simulating noncanonical HMC with   cid   
             and the noncanonical matrix

  and then transforming back to

ii  On the other hand if we apply   change of basis  via an
invertible matrix    to our coordinates  cid       simulate HMC in the  cid     coordinates  and transform back
to the original basis using    this is exactly equivalent to
noncanonical HMC with

Lemma   illustrates   fact alluded to in  Neal    using

algorithm invariant 

  Magnetic Dynamics

The primary focus of this paper is to investigate the subcase
of the dynamics where 

for two important reasons  Firstly for this choice of   we
can construct an explicit  symplectic  leapfroglike integration scheme which is important for developing an ef cient
HMC sampler as discussed in Section   Secondly  the
dynamics have an interesting physical interpretation quite
distinct from mass preconditioning and other HMC variants
like Riemannian HMC  Girolami et al   
Lemma   In   dimensions the noncanonical Hamiltonian
dynamics corresponding to the Hamiltonian        
    cid   and   matrix as in   are equivalent to
       
the Newtonian mechanics of   charged particle  with unit
mass and charge  coupled to   magnetic  eld  cid    given
by   particular function of     see Appendix    
dt   
         
This interpretation is perhaps surprising since Hamiltonian
formulations of classical magnetism are uncommon  although the quantum mechanical treatment naturally incorporates   Hamiltonian framework  However  in light of
Lemma   we might wonder if by   clever rewriting of the
Hamiltonian we can reproduce this system of ODEs using
the canonical   matrix                        This is
not the case 
Lemma   The noncanonical Hamiltonian dynamics with
    cid  
magnetic   and Hamiltonian                
cannot be obtained using canonical Hamiltonian dynamics
for any choice of smooth Hamiltonian   See Appendix

 Note that the effect of   nonidentity   matrix can be
achieved by simply composing these magnetic dynamics with  
coordinatetransformation as suggested in Lemma

  The Magnetic HMC  MHMC  Algorithm
Using the results discussed in Section   and Section   we
can now propose Magnetic HMC   see Algorithm

One further remark is that by construction the integrator for
magnetic HMC is expected to have similarly good energy
conservation properties to the integrator of standard HMC 
Lemma   The symplectic leapfroglike integrator for
magnetic HMC will have the same local      and
global      error scaling  over      
  steps  as
the canonical leapfrog integrator of standard HMC if the
Hamiltonian is separable   See Appendix 
It is worthwhile to contrast the algorithmic differences between magnetic HMC and ordinary HMC  Intuitively  the
role of the  ow   
        which reduces to the standard
Euler translation update of ordinary HMC when      
  is to introduce   rotation into the momentum space of
the  ow  In particular    nonzero element Gij will allow
momentum to periodically  ow between pi and pj  If we
regard   as an element in the Lie algebra of antisymmetric matrices  which can be thought of as in nitesimal rotations  then the exponential map exp    will project this
transformation into the Lie group of real orthogonal linear
maps 
With respect to computational cost  although magnetic
HMC requires matrix exponentiation diagonalization to
simulate   
      this only needs to be computed once upfront for    and cached  moreover  as    is diagonalizable  the exact exponential can be calculated in      time 
Additionally  there is an      cost for the matrixvector
products needed to implement the  ow   
      as with
preconditioning  However  it is possible to design sparsi

 ed matrix representations of   which will translate into
sparsi ed rotations if we only wish to  curl  in   speci  
subspace of dimension      which will translate into   computational cost of     
An important problem to address is the selection of the  
matrix  which affords   great deal of  exibility to MHMC
relative to HMC  this point is further discussed in the Experiments section  where we argue that in certain cases intuitive heuristics can be used to select the   matrix 

  and     

  respectively 

  Experiments
Here we investigate the performance of magnetic HMC
against standard HMC in several examples  in each case
commenting on our choice of the magnetic  eld term   
Step sizes   and number of leapfrog steps     were tuned
to achieve an acceptance rate between       after which
the norm of the nonzero elements in   was set to    
which was found to work well 
In the Appendix we also display illustrations of different
MHMC proposals across several targets in order to provide
more intuition for MHMC   dynamics  Further experimental details and an additional experiment on   Gaussian funnel target are also provided in the Appendix 

  Multiscale Gaussians

We consider two highly illconditioned Gaussians similar
to as in  SohlDickstein et al    to illustrate   heuristic
for   matrix selection and demonstrate properties of the
magnetic dynamics  In particular we consider   centered 
uncorrelated    Gaussian with covariance eigenvalues of
  and   as well as   centered  uncorrelated    Gaussian with two large covariance eigenvalues of   and remaining eigenvalues of   We denote their coordinates as
                and                         respectively  HMC will have dif culty exploring the directions of

illconditioned Gaussian  left  and Averaged Autocorrelation of
HMC vs MHMC on      illconditioned Gaussian 

large marginal variance since its exploration will often be
limited by the smaller variance directions  Accordingly  in
order to induce   periodic momentum  ow between the directions of small and large variance  we introduce nonzero
components Gij into the subspaces spanned directly between the large and small eigenvalues  Indeed  we  nd that
magnetic   term is encouraging more ef cient exploration
as we can see from the averaged autocorrelation of samples
generated from the HMC MHMC chains   see Figure  
Further  by running the   parallel chains for   timesteps 
we computed both the bias and Monte Carlo standard errors

of an evenly weighted mixture of isotropic Gaussians 
     
        
 xy     and       This problem is challenging for HMC because the gradients in canonical Hamiltonian dynamics force it to one of the two modes  We
tuned HMC to achieve an acceptance rate of     and
used the same     for MHMC  generating   samples
from both HMC and MHMC with these settings  The addition of the magnetic  eld term     which has one degree of freedom in this case   introduces an asymmetric
 curl  into the dynamics that pushes the sampler across
the saddlepoint to the other mode allowing it to ef ciently
mix around both modes and between them   see Figure
  The maximum mean discrepancy between exact samples generated from the target density and samples generated from both HMC and MHMC chains was also estimated for various magnitudes of    using   quadratic ker

  FitzHughNagumo model

Finally  we consider the problem of Bayesian inference
over the parameters of the FitzHughNagumo model    set
of nonlinear ordinary differential equations  originally developed to model the behavior of axial spiking potentials
in neurons  as in  Ramsay et al    Girolami   Calderhead    The FitzHughNagumo model is   dynamical
system             de ned by the following coupled differential equations 

                               
                     bR    

 

We consider the problem where the initial conditions

of noisecorrupted observations  cid    tn cid   tn  
        of the system   are known  and   set
    
   at discrete time points
 Va     tn  
                  tN   are available   note that we illustrate dependence of the trajectories on the model parameters explicitly via subscripts  It is not possible to recover
the true parameter values of the model from these observations  but we can obtain   posterior distribution over them
by specifying   model for the observation noise and   prior
distribution over the model parameters 
Similar to  Ramsay et al    Girolami   Calderhead 
  we assume that the observation noise variables
   are iid       and take an in 
  
    
dependent       prior over each parameter       and   
This yields   posterior distribution of the form

   and

Importantly  the highly nonlinear dependence of the trajectory on the parameters      and   yields   complex posterior distribution   see Figure   Full details of the model

For our experiments  we used  xed parameter settings of
                  to generate   evenlyspaced noisecorrupted observations over the time interval
         as in  Ramsay et al    Girolami   Calderhead    We performed inference over the posterior
distribution of parameters           with this set of observations using both the HMC and MHMC algorithms  which
was perturbed with   magnetic  eld in each of the   axial planes of parameters   along the ab  ac  and bc axes

note that all methods achieved nearly perfect mixing over
the  rst coordinate so their effective sample size were
truncated at   for the   coordinate 
In this example 
we can see that all magnetic perturbations slightly increase
the mixing rate of the sampler over each of the       
coordinates with the ab perturbation performing best 

  Discussion and Conclusion
We have investigated   framework for MCMC algorithms
based on noncanonical Hamiltonian dynamics and have
given   construction for an explicit  symplectic integrator
that is used to implement   generalization of HMC we refer to as magnetic HMC  We have also shown several examples where the noncanonical dynamics of MHMC can
improve upon the sampling performance of standard HMC 
Important directions for further research include  nding
more automated  adaptive mechanisms to set the matrix   
as well as investigating positionallydependent magnetic
 eld components  similar to how Riemannian HMC corresponds to local preconditioning  We believe that exploiting
more general deterministic  ows  such as also maintaining
  nonzero   in the top leftblock of   general   matrix 
could form   fruitful area for further research on MCMC
methods
